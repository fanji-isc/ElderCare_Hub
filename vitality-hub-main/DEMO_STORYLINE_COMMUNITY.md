# Neighborhood Health Hub (NHH) — Demo Storyline: Community Connection & Mental Health

---

## The Character

**Frank, 74** — retired engineer, lives alone in the same neighborhood as Barbara. His wife of 48 years, Carol, passed away 14 months ago. Since then:

- Rarely leaves the apartment after Carol died
- Skips meals or eats the same simple things
- Sleeps irregularly — wakes at 2am, can't fall back asleep, stays in bed until 10
- Tells his son **David** he's "fine" every Sunday phone call — the calls have been getting shorter
- Was recently screened for mild depression by **Dr. Kim** — not on medication yet, but being monitored

Frank is not sick. He is **lonely** — and loneliness, for someone his age, is as dangerous as any chronic condition.

## What NHH Monitors Every Day

Four signals, checked daily:

| Signal | This Week | Flag |
|--------|-----------|------|
| **Steps** | 1,240 → 860 → 600 → 480 → 390 | Declining trend |
| **Sleep** | 4.8 hrs avg, waking 3–4x/night | Below target (7–8 hrs) |
| **Smart Fridge** | 1–2 meals/day, no real meal cooked in 4 days | Low nutrition variety |
| **Phone Calls** | 6 min total this week (1 call from David) | Declining month-over-month |

## NOHA's Proactive Daily Check-Ins

Every morning, NOHA reviews all four signals and sends Frank two short check-ins — one for movement and rest, one for groceries and getting there.

### Check-In 1 — Steps & Sleep

> "Good morning, Frank. You only got about 5 hours last night and your steps have been low this week. I know the days feel long sometimes. There's a chair yoga session Saturday at 9am — Barbara and Marcus are going, small group, very gentle. Want me to sign you up and call a Lyft to get you there?"

Frank: *"...Maybe the yoga. I'll try."*

> "Done. I'll have your Lyft outside at 8:40am Saturday — plenty of time. I'll send a reminder the night before."

### Check-In 2 — Groceries

> "Frank, your fridge is looking a little light — I noticed you haven't had much to eat the past few days. I put together a short list: eggs, tomatoes, bread, soup, fruit, chicken, olive oil. Seven things. Want me to place a DoorDash order? It'll be at your door in about 30 minutes."

Frank: *"That'd actually be helpful, yeah."*

> "Perfect — order placed. You'll get a notification when it's on the way."

## What NHH Shows Frank on His Dashboard

Alongside his usual health metrics, Frank sees a **Community tab**:

- **Saturday 9am** — Chair Yoga · Community Center · 6 neighbors joining · Beginner friendly
- **Sunday 2pm** — Neighborhood Walk · Riverside Path · 4 people signed up · 45 min easy pace
- **Tuesday 10am** — Meditation Circle · Online or in-person · Hosted by NHH volunteer coordinator
- **Next Friday** — Group Hiking Trip · City Nature Reserve · Moderate trail · Sign-ups open

Each activity shows **who from his neighborhood is going** — not strangers, but familiar faces.

> *"Frank doesn't need to be pushed into a gym. He needs to see that people he knows are showing up — and that there's a place for him too."*

---

## Saturday — The Data Changes

Frank goes to yoga and stays for coffee. Step count: **2,400** — the highest in three weeks. That evening he makes pasta for the first time since Carol died. He calls David — not to report he's fine, just to say the class was good. The call lasts **22 minutes**.

The following Monday, NOHA opens with: *"Last week looked a lot better — more steps, better sleep, and you cooked. How are you feeling?"* Frank says he'll try the Sunday walk too.

## Dr. Kim's View

| Period | Steps/Day | Sleep (hrs) | Meals/Day | Social Calls/Week |
|--------|-----------|-------------|-----------|------------------|
| Weeks 1–3 | 520 | 4.8 | 1.4 | 6 min |
| Week 4+ | 1,840 | 6.3 | 2.6 | 34 min |

NHH note: *"2 community activities this week. Sleep up 1.5 hrs. Social contact up 5x. Trajectory positive — no medication recommended at this time."*

---

## David's View

David's panel shows yoga Saturday, walk Sunday, meals and sleep improving, and a call from Dad on Saturday night. NOHA's note: *"Frank is reconnecting. Keep reaching out — your calls matter to him."*

David texts: *"Hey Dad — heard you've been getting out more."*
Frank: *"Met a few good people. Might go again next week."*

## The Twist — What Could Have Happened

**Without NHH:**
- Declining steps, sleep, and appetite go unnoticed between Sunday calls
- Isolation deepens silently — mild depression becomes clinical
- A crisis eventually brings Frank to the hospital

**With NHH:**
- NOHA catches the pattern early and acts — a Lyft to yoga, a DoorDash for groceries
- Frank reconnects with neighbors; his numbers improve before the next appointment
- David knows his dad is okay — not because Frank said so, but because the data shows it

## The Closing Message

Loneliness among older adults is a public health crisis — studies show it carries the same health risk as smoking 15 cigarettes a day. Yet most care systems have no way to see it coming. 

NHH changes that — connecting steps, sleep, fridge, and social signals so Frank's doctor, his son, and Frank himself never have to wait for a crisis to know something's wrong.

Because sometimes the most powerful intervention isn't a prescription. It's NOHA noticing that the fridge hasn't been opened since Tuesday and asking — gently, without alarm — *"How are you really doing today, Frank?"*

And a familiar face at a yoga class who says: *"I'm glad you came."*

> **"NHH doesn't just monitor your heart. It watches out for the part of you that doesn't show up on a chart."**
