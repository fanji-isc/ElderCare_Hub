In achalasia, the muscles in the oesophagus do not contract correctly and the ring of muscle can fail to open properly, or does not open at all. Food and drink cannot pass into the stomach and becomes stuck. It is often brought back up."

Wash the affected area with a mild soap or cleanser and lukewarm water. Very hot or cold water can make acne worse. Do not try to \"clean out\" blackheads or squeeze spots. This can make them worse and cause permanent scarring . Avoid make-up, skincare and suncare products that are oil-based (sometimes labelled “comedogenic”). Use water-based non-comedogenic products, as they’re less likely to block the pores in your skin. Completely remove make-up before going to bed. If dry skin is a problem, use a fragrance-free water-based emollient . Regular exercise cannot improve your acne, but it can boost your mood and improve your self-esteem. Shower as soon as possible once you finish exercising as sweat can irritate your acne. Wash your hair regularly and try to avoid letting your hair fall across your face. Although acne cannot be cured, it can be controlled with treatment. If you develop mild acne , it's a good idea to speak to a pharmacist for advice. Several creams, lotions and gels for treating spots are available to buy from pharmacies. Products containing a low concentration of benzoyl peroxide may be recommended, but be careful as this can bleach clothing. If your acne is severe or appears on your chest and back, it may need to be treated with antibiotics or stronger creams that are only available on prescription."

Certain hormones cause the grease-producing glands next to hair follicles in the skin to produce larger amounts of oil (abnormal sebum). This abnormal sebum changes the activity of a usually harmless skin bacterium called P. acnes, which becomes more aggressive and causes inflammation and pus. The hormones also thicken the inner lining of the hair follicle, causing blockage of the pores. Cleaning the skin does not help to remove this blockage."

Calculous cholecystitis develops when the main opening to the gallbladder, the cystic duct, gets blocked by a gallstone or a substance known as biliary sludge. Biliary sludge is a mixture of bile, a liquid produced by the liver that helps digest fats, and small cholesterol and salt crystals. The blockage in the cystic duct causes bile to build up in the gallbladder, increasing the pressure inside it and causing it to become inflamed.

This can happen gradually over several years, before it can then get worse quickly over a few weeks or months. The exact cause is unknown.

People with albinism often have white or very light blonde hair, although some have brown or red hair. The exact colour depends on how much melanin their body produces. Very pale skin that burns easily in the sun and does not usually tan is also typical of albinism."

If someone loses control over their drinking and has an excessive desire to drink, it's known as dependent drinking (alcoholism). Dependent drinking usually affects a person's quality of life and relationships, but they may not always find it easy to see or accept this. Severely dependent drinkers are often able to tolerate very high levels of alcohol in amounts that would dangerously affect or even kill some people. A dependent drinker usually experiences physical and psychological withdrawal symptoms if they suddenly cut down or stop drinking, including: hand tremors – \"the shakes\" sweating seeing things that are not real (visual hallucinations ) depression anxiety difficulty sleeping (insomnia) This often leads to \"relief drinking\" to avoid withdrawal symptoms.

If you're worried about alcohol use during pregnancy, talk to your doctor or midwife. If you're trying to conceive, your partner should drink no more than 14 units of alcohol a week, which should be spread evenly over 3 days or more. Drinking alcohol excessively can affect the quality of his sperm."

Each time your liver filters alcohol, some of the liver cells die. The liver can develop new cells, but prolonged alcohol misuse (drinking too much) over many years can reduce its ability to regenerate. This can result in serious and permanent damage to your liver. ARLD is common in the UK. The number of people with the condition has been increasing over the last few decades as a result of increasing levels of alcohol misuse. Read more about the causes of ARLD"

But support, advice and medical treatment may be available through local alcohol addiction support services . A liver transplant may be required in severe cases where the liver has stopped functioning and does not improve when you stop drinking alcohol. You'll only be considered for a liver transplant if you have developed complications of cirrhosis despite having stopped drinking. All liver transplant units require people with ARLD to not drink alcohol while awaiting the transplant, and for the rest of their life."

Check with the pharmacist or check the leaflet that comes with the medicine for how long you should use it for. Boil a pint of water, then leave it to cool. Mix 1 teaspoon of salt and 1 teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda into the water. Wash your hands. Stand over a sink, cup the palm of 1 hand and pour a small amount of the solution into it. Sniff the water into 1 nostril at a time. Breathe through your mouth and allow the water to pour back into the sink. Try not to let the water go down the back of your throat. Repeat the first 5 steps up to 3 times a day (making a new solution each time) until your nose feels more comfortable.

Many people feel that memory problems are simply a part of getting older. Also, the disease process itself may (but not always) prevent people recognising changes in their memory. But Alzheimer's disease is not a \"normal\" part of the ageing process. An accurate and timely diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease can give you the best chance to prepare and plan for the future, as well as receive any treatment or support that may help. If you're worried about your memory or think you may have dementia, it's a good idea to see a GP. If possible, someone who knows you well should be with you as they can help describe any changes or problems they have noticed. If you're worried about someone else, encourage them to make an appointment and perhaps suggest that you go along with them. There's no single test that can be used to diagnose Alzheimer's disease. And it's important to remember that memory problems do not necessarily mean you have Alzheimer's disease. A GP will ask questions about any problems you're experiencing and may do some tests to rule out other conditions. If Alzheimer's disease is suspected, you may be referred to a specialist service to: assess your symptoms in more detail organise further testing, such as brain scans if necessary create a treatment and care plan Read more about diagnosing Alzheimer's disease ."

This is a mental health condition where a person spends a lot of time worrying about flaws in their appearance, which are often unnoticeable to others. People who have body dysmorphic disorder may take anabolic steroids because they do not see themselves as being physically big enough or strong enough.

Users might: take anabolic steroids for a period of time and then stop for a rest period before starting again – this is known as \"cycling\" take more than 1 type of anabolic steroid or other performance-enhancing medicine at a time, known as \"stacking\", which they believe makes the steroids work better or will counter the side effects of the steroids do something called \"pyramiding\", sometimes used during the training period before a competition, where an athlete will start taking a low dose of 1 or more anabolic steroids and then increase the dose over time up to a maximum dose – they then reduce the dose in the period leading up to a competition to avoid detection during drug testing But there is no evidence that any of these methods actually reduce the side effects and harms caused by taking anabolic steroids. Users tend to exercise more when they're taking high doses to make the most of their improved performance during this time."

Drinking orange juice after you've taken a tablet may help your body absorb the iron. Follow the GP's advice about how to take iron tablets. Some people get side effects when taking iron tablets like: constipation or diarrhoea tummy pain heartburn feeling sick darker than usual poo Try taking the tablets with or soon after food to reduce the chance of side effects. It's important to keep taking the tablets, even if you get side effects. Your GP may carry out repeat blood tests over the next few months to check that your iron level is getting back to normal."

It’s usually caused by an infection near the anus, which results in a collection of pus (abscess) in the nearby tissue. When the pus drains away, it can leave a small channel behind. Anal fistulas can cause unpleasant symptoms, such as discomfort and skin irritation, and will not usually get better on their own. Surgery is recommended in most cases."

A penis does not form or is underdeveloped. This means the child's genitals may develop as female, or are underdeveloped as male. The child may have fully or partially undescended testicles . But there will be no womb or ovaries. Women who carry the genetic alteration will not have AIS themselves, but there's a 1 in 4 chance each child they have will be born with AIS.

                "text": "A child with Angelman syndrome will begin to show signs of delayed development at around 6 to 12 months of age, such as being unable to sit unsupported or make babbling noises. Later, they may not speak at all or may only be able to say a few words. However, most children with Angelman syndrome will be able to communicate using gestures, signs or other systems. The movement of a child with Angelman syndrome will also be affected. They may have difficulty walking because of issues with balance and co-ordination ( ataxia ). Their arms may tremble or make jerky movements, and their legs may be stiff. Several distinctive behaviours are associated with Angelman syndrome, although a child with the condition may not have all of these behaviours. They include: frequent laughter and smiling, often with little stimulus being easily excitable, often flapping the hands being restless (hyperactive) having a short attention span trouble sleeping and needing less sleep than other children a particular fascination with water By around 2 years of age, a small head which may also be flat at the back (microbrachycephaly) may be noticeable in some children with Angelman syndrome. Children with Angelman syndrome may also start to have seizures or fits around this age. Other possible features of the syndrome include: tendency to stick the tongue out crossed eyes (strabismus) skin, hair and eyes that are paler than other family members a wide mouth with widely spaced teeth a side-to-side curvature of the spine ( scoliosis ) walking with arms in the air Some young babies with Angelman syndrome may have difficulties feeding because they're unable to co-ordinate sucking and swallowing. In such cases, they may need to be fed through a feeding tube. Babies with Angelman syndrome may need to be treated for reflux."

                "text": "In most cases of Angelman syndrome, the child's parents do not have the condition and the genetic difference responsible for the syndrome happens by chance around the time of conception. Angelman syndrome usually happens when the gene known as UBE3A is either missing or not working properly. A gene is a single unit of genetic material (DNA) that acts as an instruction for the way an individual is made and develops. Usually a child gets 2 copies of this gene, one from each parent, but only the gene from the mother is active. Most cases of Angelman syndrome are caused by the child not getting a copy of the UBE3A gene from its mother, or the gene not working. This means there's no active copy of the gene in the child's brain. In a small number of cases, Angelman syndrome happens when a child gets 2 inactive copies of the gene from their father, rather than 1 from each parent. Sometimes the cause of Angelman syndrome is unknown. Most children in these unexplained cases have different conditions involving other genes or chromosomes."

A blood test is used to confirm the diagnosis. Several genetic tests will be done on the blood sample. These tests look for: any chromosomes or pieces of chromosomes that are missing changes in the mother's or father's UBE3A gene that they may have passed on changes in the child's UBE3A gene that would stop it from working For each child with Angelman syndrome, it's important to know the genetic change that caused the condition. This helps to determine your chance of having another child with Angelman syndrome. Most children with Angelman syndrome are diagnosed between the ages of 9 months to 6 years, when physical and behavioural symptoms become apparent. If your child is diagnosed with Angelman syndrome, you will be able to talk to a genetic doctor about what support they might need."

With age, people with Angelman syndrome become less hyperactive and may sleep better. Most people with the syndrome will have learning disability and limited speech throughout their life. In adults, some mobility may be lost and joints may stiffen. People with Angelman syndrome usually have good general health and are often able to improve their communication and acquire new skills. While there's currently no cure for Angelman syndrome, research into treatments is being done in other countries. There are also clinical trials looking at treatment for some of the symptoms associated with Angelman syndrome, such as seizures.

Treatment with these medications can also improve a pregnant woman's chance of having a successful pregnancy.

Treatment depends on your symptoms but can include: matching words to pictures categorising or sorting words repeating words or rhyming tasks practising ways of communicating without words, like drawing, body language, hand movements and facial expressions using technology – for example, setting your phone to be voice-activated or taking pictures of things you struggle to name recommending speech and language therapy apps or computer programs to help you practise Speech and language therapy may be done individually, in a group, face to face or online. It also usually involves the people around you, like your family or friends, and anyone who may help care for you."

It can be very frustrating, confusing and difficult if you or someone you know has aphasia. It can affect people's relationships and independence in daily life, and cause anxiety, low mood and depression , loneliness or isolation. Talking therapies and support from your care team can help with these problems. If aphasia was caused by a stroke, head injury or brain tumour, most people improve with treatment, especially in the first few months. People can still improve months or years later, and some do recover fully. If aphasia is caused by a condition that gets worse over time, like dementia, the symptoms are likely to get worse. Treatment may focus on learning and practising other ways of communicating, like drawing, body language or using technology. Speech and language therapy should help, and there are things you and others can do to help manage aphasia."

It may feel slightly better when you pull your knees up to your chest. Some people with appendicitis do not have the usual pain symptoms. For example, you might have pain that's less severe, develops more slowly, or in a different place. This can be more likely if you're pregnant and in young children and older people. Other symptoms of appendicitis can include: feeling or being sick, or loss of appetite a high temperature constipation or diarrhoea peeing more than usual sudden confusion (in older people) If appendicitis is not treated quickly, your appendix can burst. If this happens your pain may suddenly get better for a short time. You'll then usually have severe pain that spreads to the whole of your abdomen. It may be very painful to move. Many other conditions can cause pain in your abdomen, including: urinary tract infections kidney stones or gallstones bowel problems such as irritable bowel syndrome or Crohn's disease conditions affecting your womb or ovaries, such as pelvic inflammatory disease or a ruptured ovarian cyst an ectopic pregnancy But do not try to diagnose the problem yourself.

It can be hard to diagnose because the symptoms can be similar to other conditions. Sometimes doctors will try waiting a few hours to see how your symptoms develop in hospital.

If you need surgery, it will be done as soon as possible, but you may need to wait a few hours. The operation usually takes about an hour. The main steps of an appendectomy are: You'll be given a general anaesthetic , so you'll be asleep and will not feel any pain. The surgeon makes some small cuts in your abdomen (tummy), and uses a thin tube with a camera to see your appendix ( keyhole surgery ). Sometimes they'll need to make a larger cut in the lower right side of your abdomen (open surgery). The surgeon removes your appendix by cutting where it's joined to your bowel. If your appendix has burst, the area will be cleaned. Your abdomen is closed with stitches, clips or glue. Sometimes it's possible to treat appendicitis with antibiotics rather than surgery. This may be recommended if the infection has not spread and surgery is high risk for you. Sometimes appendicitis causes a lump where part of your abdomen and bowel stick to your appendix, called an appendix mass. If this happens you'll usually need antibiotics first, and then surgery a few weeks later if you still have symptoms."

In most cases, this does not occur until a person is between 30 and 40 years of age. Less commonly, children or older people may have noticeable symptoms as a result of ADPKD. When ADPKD reaches this stage, it can cause a wide range of problems, including: tummy (abdominal) pain high blood pressure (hypertension) blood in the urine (haematuria) , which may not always be noticeable to the naked eye potentially serious upper urinary tract infections (UTIs) kidney stones Kidney function may gradually deteriorate until so much is lost that kidney failure occurs.

A child has a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of developing ADPKD if one of their parents has the faulty PKD1 or PKD2 gene. Autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) is a rarer type of kidney disease that can only be inherited if both parents carry the faulty gene.

                "text": "ARPKD is caused by a genetic fault that disrupts normal development of the kidneys and liver. In particular, the growth and development of the small tubes that make up the kidneys is affected, causing bulges and cysts (fluid-filled sacs) to develop within them. Over time, the cysts cause the kidneys to become enlarged and scarred (fibrosis), resulting in the deterioration of overall kidney function. Similar problems also affect the small tubes (bile ducts) that allow a digestive fluid called bile to flow out of the liver. The bile ducts may develop abnormally and cysts may grow inside them. The liver can also become scarred over time. ARPKD is caused by a genetic alteration in the gene PKHD1, which in most cases is passed on to a child by their parents. If both parents carry a faulty version of this gene, there's a 1 in 4 chance of each child they have developing ARPKD. The way ARPKD is inherited is different from a more common type of kidney disease called autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) , which usually does not cause significantly reduced kidney function until adulthood. Sometimes ADPKD can happen when only one parent has passed on a faulty gene, but this is rare. Find out more about the causes of ARPKD"

It's not clear what triggers this problem with the immune system, but 2 things are thought to play a role: genes – Behçet's disease tends to be much more common in certain ethnic groups where the genes that are linked to the condition may be more common environmental factors – although a specific environmental factor has not been identified, rates of Behçet's disease are lower in people from an at-risk ethnic group who live outside their native country Behçet's disease is more common in the Far East, the Middle East and Mediterranean countries such as Turkey and Israel.

If treatment is needed, the main treatment is surgery to remove the tumour. This usually involves cutting out a small piece of skull so the surgeon can remove the tumour. The piece is then fixed back in place and the cut in your skin is closed with stitches. Some people may need other treatments, such as: radiotherapy (where radiation is used to kill the tumour cells) chemotherapy (where medicines are used to kill the tumour cells) treatment for any symptoms caused by the tumour (for example, medicines for nausea, seizures or pain)"

They may not cause any symptoms if they're small enough to be passed out of the bladder when you pee. But most people with bladder stones do experience symptoms because the stones either irritate the wall of the bladder or block the flow of urine. Typical symptoms of bladder stones include: lower abdominal pain, which can often be severe (men may also have pain in or around their penis) pain or difficulty when peeing peeing more frequently (particularly at night) cloudy or dark-coloured urine blood in the urine Most cases of bladder stones affect men aged 50 or older because of the link with prostate enlargement. But both men and women can get bladder stones. It's rare for bladder stones to affect children. In children, they can lead to bedwetting , and some boys may experience priapism , a persistent and often painful erection that can last for hours."

These symptoms may not necessarily be caused by bladder stones, but need to be investigated further. If your GP suspects you have a stone in your bladder, you'll be referred to hospital for testing. A blood and a urine test will probably be carried out first. A blood test will detect if there's an infection inside your bladder. The next stage is to take an X-ray of your bladder. Not all types of bladder stones show up clearly on X-rays, so a negative X-ray result doesn't always mean that you don't have bladder stones. An ultrasound scan may be used instead of an X-ray. Bladder stones can also be identified using a cystoscopy . This is where a thin fibreoptic tube with a light and a camera at one end (a cystoscope) is inserted into the urethra (the tube that carries urine out of the body) and moved up into the bladder. The camera relays images to a screen, where they can be seen by the urologist (specialist in treating bladder conditions)."

Without treatment, botulism eventually causes paralysis that spreads down the body from the head to the legs. Symptoms can include: drooping eyelids blurred or double vision facial muscle weakness difficulty swallowing (dysphagia) slurred speech breathing difficulties Affected babies may also have a weak cry, find it difficult to feed, and have a floppy head, neck and limbs."

There are 3 main types of botulism: food-borne botulism – when someone eats food containing the toxins because it has not been properly canned, preserved or cooked wound botulism – when a wound becomes infected with the bacteria, usually as a result of injecting illegal drugs like heroin contaminated with the bacteria into muscle rather than a vein infant botulism – when a baby swallows a resistant form of the bacteria, called a spore, in contaminated soil or food, such as honey (these spores are harmless to older children and adults because the body develops defences against them from about the age of 1) iatrogenic botulism – when too much toxin is injected when it's being used for cosmetic reasons or medical treatment, and it spreads deeper inside the body All these types of botulism are rare in the UK, but occasional cases do occur."

The affected skin will scab over and fall off within a few weeks. imiquimod cream or chemotherapy cream (such as 5-fluorouracil) – this is applied to the affected skin regularly for a few weeks. It may cause your skin to become red and inflamed before it gets better. curettage and cautery – the affected area of skin is scraped away under local anaesthetic , where the skin is numbed, and heat or electricity is used to stop any bleeding, leaving the area to scab over and heal after a few weeks. photodynamic therapy (PDT) – a light-sensitive cream is applied to the affected skin and a laser is directed on to the skin a few hours later to destroy the abnormal cells. The treatment session usually lasts between 8 to 45 minutes. You may need more than 1 session. surgery – the abnormal skin is cut out under local anaesthetic and stitches may be needed afterwards. In some cases, your dermatologist may just advise monitoring your skin closely – for example, if it's very slow growing and they feel the side effects of treatment will outweigh the benefits."

For example, they may open their eyes but not respond to their surroundings. In rare cases, a person in a vegetative state may show some sense of response that can be detected using a brain scan, but not be able to interact with their surroundings."

You may be more likely to have a brain aneurysm if other people in your family have them. Most brain aneurysms do not cause problems, but if one bursts it can cause bleeding in the space between the inside of your skull and your brain (subarachnoid space). This type of bleeding is called a subarachnoid haemorrhage. Subarachnoid haemorrhages can also be caused by: a severe head injury a problem with the way the blood vessels in your brain have formed (arteriovenous malformation)"

Other medicines can be used to help with other symptoms of brain tumours, such as anti-epileptic medicines for seizures and painkillers for headaches. Surgery is often used to remove brain tumours. The aim is to remove as much abnormal tissue as safely as possible. It's not always possible to remove all of a tumour, so further treatment with radiotherapy or chemotherapy may be needed to treat any abnormal cells left behind. Treatment for non-cancerous tumours is often successful and a full recovery is possible.

But sometimes it may be done under local anaesthetic (where you're awake but feel no pain). Most people go home the same day. It can take a while to recover from bunion surgery. You'll usually need to: rest and keep your feet raised as much as possible for at least 2 weeks avoid driving for 6 to 8 weeks stay off work for 2 to 12 weeks avoid sports for 3 to 6 months After the operation: your toes might be weaker or stiffer than before your toes may not be perfectly straight your feet may still be painful Bunions sometimes come back after surgery."

But that does not mean the condition cannot be serious. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is the most common cause of sudden unexpected death in childhood and in young athletes. The main heart chambers can become stiff, leading to back pressure on the smaller collecting chambers. This can sometimes worsen the symptoms of heart failure and lead to abnormal heart rhythms (atrial fibrillation) . Blood flow from the heart may be reduced or restricted (called obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy). Also, the mitral heart valve can become leaky, causing blood to leak backwards. Find out more about mitral valve problems . You'll also be at greater risk of developing a heart infection ( endocarditis ). These heart changes can cause dizziness, chest pain, shortness of breath and temporary loss of consciousness.

It's sometimes called arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARCVM). In arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy (ACM), the proteins that usually hold the heart muscle cells together are abnormal. Muscle cells can die and the dead muscle tissue is replaced with fatty and fibrous scar tissue. The walls of the main heart chambers become thin and stretched and cannot pump blood around the body properly. People with ACM usually have heart rhythm problems. Reduced blood flow from the heart can also lead to symptoms of heart failure . It can affect teenagers or young adults and has been the reason for some sudden unexplained deaths in young athletes. There's increasing evidence that prolonged, strenuous exercise makes the symptoms of ACM worse. It's important that people with or at risk of ACM discuss this in detail with their heart specialist (cardiologist)."

Childhood cataracts are often referred to as: congenital cataracts – cataracts present when a baby is born or shortly afterwards developmental, infantile or juvenile cataracts – cataracts diagnosed in older babies or children Cataracts in babies and children are rare.

As well as poor vision, cataracts can also cause \"wobbling eyes\" and a squint , where the eyes point in different directions. When your child is very young, it can be difficult to spot signs of cataracts. But your baby's eyes will be routinely examined at their newborn physical screening examination within 72 hours of birth, and again when they're 6 to 8 weeks old. If a congenital cataract is suspected at the newborn examination, a specialist eye doctor will see your baby within 2 weeks of the examination. If a congenital cataract is suspected at the 6 to 8 week examination, a specialist eye doctor will see your baby by the time they're 11 weeks old. Sometimes cataracts can develop in children after these screening tests. It's particularly important to spot cataracts in children quickly because early treatment can reduce the risk of long-term vision problems. You should visit a GP or tell your health visitor if you have any concerns about your child's eyesight. Read more about the symptoms of childhood cataracts and diagnosing childhood cataracts ."

In these cases, surgery to remove the affected lens (or lenses) will usually be recommended as soon as possible. Replacing the focusing power of the lens is as important as the surgery to remove it. The affected lens may sometimes be replaced with an artificial lens during surgery. But it's more common for the child to wear contact lenses or glasses after surgery to compensate for the lens that was removed. It can be difficult to predict exactly how much better your child's vision will be after treatment. It's likely there will always be a degree of reduced vision in the affected eye (or eyes).

Problems can occur if the cavernoma bleeds or presses on certain areas of the brain. The cells lining a cavernoma are often thinner than those that line normal blood vessels, which means they're prone to leaking blood. In most cases, bleeding is small – usually around half a teaspoonful of blood – and may not cause other symptoms. But severe haemorrhages can be life threatening and may lead to long-lasting problems. You should seek medical help as soon as possible if you experience any of the above symptoms for the first time."

If you or your partner have the genetic type of cavernoma, there's a 1 in 2 chance of passing on the condition to any children that you conceive.

They may also recommend having a further brain scan. MRI and CT scans can be used to detect bleeding on the brain, although they cannot necessarily identify cavernomas at an increased risk of bleeding. This is because the features of a cavernoma that can be seen on a brain scan, such as an increase in size, do not appear to be directly linked to the likelihood of bleeding.

The decision to have such treatment is made on a case-by-case basis in discussion with your doctor. Types of treatment offered in the UK to reduce the risk of haemorrhages include: neurosurgery – carried out under general anaesthetic to remove the cavernoma stereotactic radiosurgery – where a single concentrated dose of radiation is aimed directly at the cavernoma, causing it to become thickened and scarred In most cases, neurosurgery is preferred to stereotactic radiosurgery because the effectiveness of radiosurgery in preventing haemorrhages is unknown. Stereotactic radiosurgery is usually only considered if the position of the cavernoma makes neurosurgery too difficult or dangerous. Risks of invasive treatment include stroke and death, although the exact risks depend on the location of the cavernoma. You should discuss the possible risks of treatment with your doctor beforehand."

They control the muscles and relay sensory information, such as the sense of touch, from the limbs to the brain. People with CMT may have: muscle weakness in their feet, ankles, legs and hands an awkward way of walking (gait) highly arched or very flat feet numbness in the feet, arms and hands The symptoms of CMT usually start to appear between the ages of 5 and 15, although they sometimes do not develop until well into middle age or later.

Under general anaesthetic a cut is made at the back of your head and the surgeon removes a small piece of bone from the base of your skull. They may also remove a small piece of bone from the top of your spine. This will help reduce the pressure on your brain and allow the fluid in and around your brain and spinal cord to flow normally. Read more about decompression surgery for Chiari malformation: Brain & Spine Foundation: Chiari malformation - information for adults Sheffield Children’s NHS Foundation Trust: cranio-cervical decompression for Chiari malformation - information for children Other procedures that may be necessary include: Endoscopic third ventriculostomy (ETV) – a small hole is made in the wall of one of the cavities of the brain, releasing trapped fluid. See treating hydrocephalus for more information. Ventriculoperitoneal shunting – a small hole is drilled into the skull and a thin tube called a catheter is passed into the brain cavity to drain trapped fluid and relieve the pressure. See treating hydrocephalus for more information. Untethering – some children with a type 1 Chiari malformation have a tethered spinal cord, which means it is abnormally attached within the spine. Untethering involves separating the spinal cord and releasing tension in the spine. Spinal fixation – some people with Chiari I will have a hypermobility syndrome, such as Ehlers-Danlos syndrome , and may require surgery to stabilise their spine. The aim of surgery is to stop existing symptoms getting any worse. Some people also experience an improvement in their symptoms, particularly their headaches. However, surgery sometimes results in no improvement or symptoms getting worse. There's also a small risk of serious complications, such as paralysis or a stroke . Talk to your surgeon about the different surgical options and what the benefits and risks of each are."

It tends to be present from birth, but is normally only found in adulthood when symptoms develop or when an MRI scan is done. Many cases are thought to be the result of part of the skull not being large enough for the brain. Chiari I malformations can also develop in people with a tethered spinal cord, a build-up of fluid on the brain ( hydrocephalus ), and some types of brain tumour. Chiari malformations can sometimes run in families. It's possible that some children born with it may have inherited a faulty gene that caused problems with their skull development. But the risk of passing a Chiari malformation on to your child is very small. And remember: even if your children do inherit it, they may not experience symptoms."

Some scabs look soft and seem to have fluid under them. 2 of the scabs look like they have collapsed in the centre. The scabs are yellow and pink and the skin around the scabs is pink.

Some spots are 1cm to 3cm apart, some are further apart. Most spots are flat, less than 5mm, and have dark red scabs. The skin around many of the scabs looks pink. CDC/ J.D. Millar, MD, MPH, DTPH https://phil.cdc.gov/Details.aspx?pid=2885 Medium-brown skin with stage 3 chickenpox spots. The spots cover the lower part of a person's back and the side of their hip. There are about 50 spots in total, varying in size from about 1mm to 1cm. Some are 1cm to 3cm apart, but others are further apart. Most of the spots have scabs over them. The scabs are pink, purple or grey. There are also a few spots without scabs, which look like small blisters. These are slightly darker in colour than the person's skin."

It can also be caused by eating fatty food, not exercising enough, being overweight, smoking and drinking alcohol. You can lower your cholesterol by eating healthily and getting more exercise. Some people also need to take medicine. Too much cholesterol can block your blood vessels. It makes you more likely to have heart problems or a stroke.

It usually develops very slowly and does not always need to be treated straight away. Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia cannot usually be cured, but it can be managed with treatment. It's more common as you get older. It's very rare in people under 40. It's not clear what causes chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, but having a close family member who's had it may mean you have a slightly higher risk."

Since the link between variant CJD and BSE was discovered in 1996, strict controls have proved very effective in preventing meat from infected cattle entering the food chain. See preventing Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease for more information. But the average time it takes for the symptoms of variant CJD to occur after initial infection (the incubation period) is still unclear. The incubation period could be very long (more than 10 years) in some people, so those exposed to infected meat before the food controls were introduced can still develop variant CJD. The prion that causes variant CJD can also be transmitted by blood transfusion , although this has only happened 5 times in the UK. In 2020, there were no recorded deaths from variant CJD in the UK."

Synthetic versions of human growth hormone have been used since 1985, so this is no longer a risk. Iatrogenic CJD can also occur if instruments used during brain surgery on a person with CJD aren't properly cleaned between each surgical procedure and are reused on another person.

C. diff infections are treated by: stopping any antibiotics you're already taking, if possible taking a new 10-day course of another antibiotic that can treat the C. diff infection You'll also be given advice about how to avoid dehydration, such as making sure you drink plenty of water. Your symptoms should improve a few days after starting the new course of antibiotics. But it may be 1 to 2 weeks before the infection clears up completely. Go back to see the GP if your symptoms get worse, you feel very unwell after starting the antibiotics, or your symptoms come back afterwards. If your symptoms return, or you become very unwell, treatment may need to be repeated or you may need treatment in hospital. If the C. diff infection comes back 2 or more times, you may be offered a faecal microbiota transplant. This is where bacteria from a healthy person's poo is put into your gut to help stop the infection."

It's important to ensure that your gluten-free diet is healthy and balanced. An increase in the range of available gluten-free foods in recent years has made it possible to eat both a healthy and varied gluten-free diet."

But some experts think this may be underestimated because milder cases may go undiagnosed or be misdiagnosed as other digestive conditions, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) . Reported cases of coeliac disease are higher in women than men. It can develop at any age. People with certain conditions, including type 1 diabetes , autoimmune thyroid disease, Down's syndrome and Turner syndrome , have an increased risk of getting coeliac disease. First-degree relatives (parents, brothers, sisters and children) of people with coeliac disease are also at increased risk of developing the condition."

The pain usually only affects 1 limb, but it can sometimes spread to other parts of the body. The skin of the affected body part can become so sensitive that a slight touch, bump or even a change in temperature can cause intense pain. Affected areas can also become swollen, stiff or undergo fluctuating changes in colour or temperature. CRPS often gradually improves over time. But some people with CRPS experience pain for many years. Find out more about the symptoms of CRPS ."

It's sometimes called congenital dislocation of the hip, or hip dysplasia. The hip joint attaches the thigh bone (femur) to the pelvis. The top of the femur (femoral head) is rounded, like a ball, and sits inside the cup-shaped hip socket. In DDH, the socket of the hip is too shallow and the femoral head is not held tightly in place, so the hip joint is loose. In severe cases, the femur can come out of the socket (dislocate). DDH may affect 1 or both hips, but it's more common in the left hip. It's also more common in: girls firstborn children families where there have been childhood hip problems (parents, brothers or sisters) babies born in the breech position (feet or bottom downwards) after 28 weeks of pregnancy Without early treatment, DDH may lead to: problems moving around, for example a limp pain osteoarthritis of the hip and back With early diagnosis and treatment, children are less likely to need surgery, and more likely to develop normally."

The examination involves gently moving your baby's hip joints to check if there are any problems. It should not cause them any discomfort. If a doctor, midwife or nurse thinks your baby's hip feels unstable, they should have an ultrasound scan of their hip between 4 and 6 weeks old. Babies should also have an ultrasound scan of their hip between 4 and 6 weeks old if: there have been childhood hip problems in your family your baby was born in the breech position (feet or bottom downwards) after 28 weeks of pregnancy If you have had twins or multiples and 1 of the babies was in the breech position, each baby should have an ultrasound scan of their hips by the time they're 4 to 6 weeks old. Sometimes a baby's hip stabilises on its own before the scan is due, but they should still be checked to make sure. Get help and support from the charity Steps if your baby's been diagnosed with DDH"

The harness may be adjusted during follow-up appointments. Your clinician will discuss your baby's progress with you. Your hospital will provide detailed instructions on how to look after your baby while they're wearing a Pavlik harness. This will include information on: how to change your baby's clothes without removing the harness – nappies can be worn normally cleaning the harness if it's soiled – it still should not be removed, but can be cleaned with detergent and an old toothbrush or nail brush positioning your baby while they sleep – they should be placed on their back and not on their side how to avoid skin irritation around the straps of the harness – you may be advised to wrap some soft, hygienic material around the bands Eventually, you may be given advice on removing and replacing the harness for short periods of time until it can be permanently removed. You'll be encouraged to allow your baby to move freely when the harness is off. Swimming is often recommended."

This involves placing the femoral head back into the hip socket. Reduction surgery is done under general anaesthetic and may be done as either: closed reduction – the femoral head is placed in the hip socket without making any large cuts open reduction – a cut is made in the groin to allow the surgeon to place the femoral head into the hip socket Your child may need to wear a cast for at least 12 weeks after the operation. Their hip will be checked under general anaesthetic again after 6 weeks, to make sure it's stable and healing well. After this investigation, your child will probably wear a cast for at least another 6 weeks to allow their hip to fully stabilise. Some children may also require bone surgery (osteotomy) during an open reduction, or at a later date, to correct any bone deformities."

Tau occurs naturally in the brain and is usually broken down before it reaches high levels. In people with CBD, it isn't broken down properly and forms harmful clumps in brain cells. CBD has been linked to changes in certain genes, but these genetic links are weak and the risk to other family members is very low."

CBD usually changes very slowly. Many people find it helpful to plan ahead with their doctors (GP and specialist) to make decisions about what to do in later stages of the illness. Difficulty swallowing can cause choking, or inhaling food or liquid into the airways. This can lead to pneumonia , which can be life-threatening. As a result of these complications, the average life expectancy for someone with CBD is around 6 to 8 years from when their symptoms start. However, this is only an average and CBD is very variable."

It's usually found on the scalp and face, but sometimes affects the nappy area and areas where the skin creases. It can look like: patches of white or yellow greasy scales on the scalp and face that form a crust which might flake off small, dry flakes of skin on the nappy area The scales look similar on all skin tones. But the skin under and around the scales may look pink or red if your baby has white skin, or lighter or darker than the surrounding skin if your baby has brown or black skin. It is not itchy or painful and does not bother your baby.

Surgery may involve: removing the damaged part of your gut and joining healthy sections together, called a bowel resection removing part of your gut and bringing the end of your bowel through an opening made in your tummy (stoma), called an ileostomy or colostomy You may also need surgery to treat any complications affecting your gut. Surgery can work well to reduce symptoms. But there's a chance that symptoms will come back in another part of your gut after surgery. The surgeon will explain the risks and benefits of the operation, and what will happen."

Each episode can last anything from a few hours up to a few days. They begin with sweating, feeling sick and looking paler than usual, followed by retching (trying to be sick) and vomiting. Other symptoms of cyclical vomiting syndrome may include: being very tired (exhaustion) loss of appetite tummy pain diarrhoea dizziness headaches eye pain when looking at bright lights Episodes usually start at the same time of day or night and last for the same length of time. Once these symptoms improve, most people with cyclical vomiting syndrome feel better for a few weeks or months until a new episode begins. Cyclical vomiting syndrome often starts in children around 5 years old and improves as they get older. But it can also affect adults and is often more severe in adults who did not have the condition as a child."

The proteins mainly build up in the frontal and temporal lobes of the brain at the front and sides. These are important for controlling language, behaviour, and the ability to plan and organise. It's not fully understood why this happens, but there's often a genetic link. People who get frontotemporal dementia may have relatives who were also affected by the condition. If you have a family history of frontotemporal dementia, you may want to consider talking to your doctor about being referred to a geneticist and possibly having a genetic test to see if you're at risk. There's a lot of research being done to try to improve understanding of the causes of frontotemporal dementia so treatments can be discovered.

Your GP can do some simple checks to try to find the cause of your symptoms. They can refer you to a memory clinic or another specialist for further tests if needed.

You're then given a glucose drink. After resting for 2 hours, another blood sample is taken to see how your body is dealing with the glucose.

You'll also be advised about things you can do to reduce your risk of getting diabetes, such as maintaining a healthy weight, eating a balanced diet and exercising regularly. Some research has suggested that babies of mothers who had gestational diabetes may be more likely to develop diabetes or become obese later in life. If you have a history of gestational diabetes, or currently have it, the NHS Diabetes Prevention Programme can support you. If you self-refer to the programme, you can get help with diet, exercise and maintaining your weight."

Read more about diabetes in pregnancy . If you have an unplanned pregnancy, talk to your GP and tell them you had gestational diabetes in your previous pregnancy. If tests show you do not have diabetes, you'll be offered screening earlier in pregnancy (soon after your first midwife appointment) and another test at 24 to 28 weeks if the first test is normal. Alternatively, your midwife or doctor may suggest you test your blood sugar levels yourself using a finger-pricking device in the same way as you did during your previous gestational diabetes."

                "text": "Diabetes insipidus is caused by problems with a hormone called arginine vasopressin (AVP), also called antidiuretic hormone (ADH). AVP plays a key role in regulating the amount of fluid in the body. It's produced by specialist nerve cells in a part of the brain known as the hypothalamus. AVP passes from the hypothalamus to the pituitary gland, where it's stored until needed. The pituitary gland releases AVP when the amount of water in the body becomes too low. It helps retain water in the body by reducing the amount of water lost through the kidneys, making the kidneys produce more concentrated urine. In most cases of diabetes insipidus, the lack of production of AVP means the kidneys cannot make enough concentrated urine and too much water is passed from the body. This is called AVP deficiency (previously called cranial diabetes insipidus). In rare cases, the kidneys do not respond to AVP. This causes a specific form of diabetes insipidus called AVP resistance (formerly nephrogenic diabetes insipidus). People feel thirsty as the body tries to compensate for the increased loss of water by increasing the amount of water taken in. Find out more about the causes of diabetes insipidus"

This happens because of a difference with your genes or how you respond to the sex hormones in your body, or both. It can be inherited, but there is often no clear reason why it happens. The most common times to find out that a person has a DSD are around the time of their birth or when they're a teenager."

For example, they may have a more developed clitoris and their vagina may be closed. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XX DSD. The most common cause is congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH). A person who has CAH lacks an enzyme (chemical substance) that their body needs to make the hormones cortisol and aldosterone. Without these hormones, their body produces more androgens (sex hormones that are naturally higher in males). If the child is female, the raised androgen levels before birth can cause their genitals to look different, such as a larger clitoris and a vagina that is not open in the usual place. CAH can also cause serious health issues, such as life-threatening kidney problems that need to be treated as soon as possible Find out more: The Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children: CAH (congenital adrenal hyperplasia) Living with CAH - what is CAH?"

Sometimes it's difficult at first to know whether their genitals are more similar to girls' or boys'. A person may have a womb and may also have testicles inside their body. Sometimes the testicles might not work properly. Doctors refer to this condition as 46,XY DSD. Many people with 46,XY DSD are boys born with the opening to pass urine towards the bottom of their penis or below it. For some, the scrotum appears separated into two smaller sacs, one on either side. Doctors call this peno-scrotal hypospadias and boys and men with this DSD can have either fully developed or partially developed testes. There are several causes of 46,XY DSD. One possible cause is androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) , where the body \"ignores\" androgens or is insensitive to them. Sometimes a person's body does not respond at all or only partly responds to androgens. Complete insensitivity to androgens makes a person with XY chromosomes female. Partial insensitivity to androgens can mean that some people are male and others are female."

Their internal and external sex organs can be either male or female, but they may not go through a full physical development at puberty. For example, a child with female sex organs may not start having periods. Doctors call this sex chromosome DSD. One type is Klinefelter syndrome , which is where a boy is born with an extra X chromosome (XXY). This can mean they do not produce the usual level of testosterone, the sex hormone responsible for the development of male characteristics, such as the testes and body hair. Testosterone is also important for bone strength and fertility in men. Another example of this type of DSD is Turner syndrome , which is where a girl is born with a missing X chromosome. Girls and women with Turner syndrome are often infertile and their height may be shorter than average. Find out more: Klinefelter’s Syndrome Association Turner Syndrome Support Society – What is TS?"

This is usually enough time to complete the tests, discuss the results with your child’s care team and identify your baby’s sex. Many forms of DSD do not require any medical care other than understanding the baby's development and knowing what to expect as they grow older. A specialist nurse in your care team can help you learn about DSD and a psychologist will help you address any concerns you have.

Initially, these patches are often swollen, blistered (covered with small fluid-filled pockets) and ooze fluid. They also tend to be very itchy, particularly at night. Over time, the patches may become dry, crusty, cracked and flaky. The centre of the patch also sometimes clears, leaving a ring of discoloured skin that can be mistaken for ringworm . You may just have 1 patch of discoid eczema, but most people get several patches. The skin between the patches is often dry. Patches of discoid eczema can sometimes become infected. Signs of an infection can include: the patches oozing a lot of fluid a yellow crust developing over the patches the skin around the patches becoming hot, swollen and tender or painful feeling sick feeling hot, cold or or shivery feeling unwell"

A GP should be able to make a diagnosis just by examining the affected areas of skin. In some cases they may also ask questions or arrange some tests to rule out other conditions. A GP may refer you to a doctor who specialises in skin conditions (dermatologist) if they're unsure of the diagnosis or if you need a patch test."

When your skin is very dry it cannot provide an effective barrier against substances that come into contact with it. This could allow a previously harmless substance, such as soap, to irritate your skin. It's important to look carefully at all the chemicals in cosmetics and toiletries that may have come into contact with your skin. Contact dermatitis , a type of eczema caused by coming into contact with a particular irritant, may have a role in discoid eczema. Some people with discoid eczema also have a history of atopic eczema , which often happens in people who are prone to asthma and hay fever . However, unlike atopic eczema, discoid eczema does not seem to run in families."

When small valves in the veins stop working properly, it's difficult for blood to be pushed upwards against gravity and it can leak backwards. This increases the pressure in the veins, which can cause fluid to leak into the surrounding tissue. It's thought that varicose eczema may develop as a result of the immune system reacting to this fluid. Varicose eczema is more common in people with varicose veins, as these are also often a sign that the leg veins are not working properly. Some people develop the condition for no obvious reason, although there are some factors that increase the chance of this happening, including: sex – varicose eczema is more common in women obesity – this can increase the pressure in your leg veins pregnancy – this can also increase the pressure in your leg veins a family history of venous insufficiency (where the veins in your legs have trouble sending blood back to your heart) not being able to move for a long period of time – this can affect the circulation of blood in your leg veins having previously had DVT (deep vein thrombosis) – blood clots that develop in leg veins which can damage the valves in your veins increasing age – people generally find it harder to move about as they get older, which can affect their circulation"

If screening finds something, you’ll be referred to a specialist and may be offered more scans and tests, such as non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) . The amniocentesis and CVS tests will be able to tell you if your baby definitely has Edwards’ syndrome, and what this might mean for you and your baby. It's your choice if you want to have any of these tests or not. They're the best way to find out if your baby could have Edwards' syndrome, but not everyone wants this information.

You'll usually be advised to take it between 1 and 3 hours before sex, but not more than once a day. Your response to the treatment will then be reviewed after 4 weeks (or after 6 doses), and again every 6 months. Dapoxetine is not suitable for all men diagnosed with premature ejaculation.

You might be aware of having a seizure and remember it afterwards, or you might not. Symptoms of epilepsy often start in young children and people over 50, but it can happen at any age. Epileptic seizures are different from febrile seizures , which can happen in children when they have a high temperature. Find out what to do if someone has a seizure"

You'll usually be seen the same day so that you can start treatment quickly. You'll usually be prescribed either: an antiviral medicine such as aciclovir , taken as eye ointment, eye drops or sometimes tablets antiviral medicine with steroid eye drops to reduce swelling Most infections will get better with treatment in a couple of weeks and will not permanently affect your eyesight. It's common for herpes simplex eye infections to come back. If you keep getting them a doctor might recommend that you take antiviral tablets every day to help prevent infections. If treatment does not work or you keep getting the infections, your cornea (the transparent front part of your eye) might become scarred, causing sight loss. If this happens you might need to have a cornea transplant . If you use contact lenses, do not wear them until 24 hours after all your symptoms have gone."

You usually get the herpes simplex virus from skin to skin contact from someone with a cold sore. Once you have it, it stays in your body. It does not usually cause any symptoms, but sometimes it can cause eye infections. This is more likely if you have a weakened immune system. It might also be triggered by an illness, stress, exposure to bright light or an eye injury. You're unlikely to pass the virus on to someone else from an eye infection, but try to avoid touching your eye, and wash your hands regularly."

Others may not recognise the faces of friends and family, or even their own face. Other symptoms of prosopagnosia can include difficulty with: recognising emotions on people's faces recognising people's age and gender recognising characters and following plots in TV programmes or films recognising other things, such as cars or animals finding your way around Difficulty recognising faces may make it harder to form relationships, or cause problems at work or school.

FGM is usually carried out on young girls between infancy and the age of 15, most commonly before puberty starts. It's illegal in the UK and is child abuse. It's very painful and can seriously harm the health of women and girls. It can also cause long-term problems with sex, childbirth and mental health."

Anaesthetics and antiseptics are not generally used, and FGM is often carried out using knives, scissors, scalpels, pieces of glass or razor blades.

See a GP if you think you have fibromyalgia. Treatment can ease some of the symptoms, although they're unlikely to disappear completely."

It's also suggested that some people are more likely to develop fibromyalgia because of genes inherited from their parents. In many cases, the condition appears to be triggered by things that are physical or emotional like an injury, an infection or stress."

The condition typically develops between the ages of 25 and 55, but people of any age can get it, including children and older people. It's not clear exactly how many people are affected by fibromyalgia, although research has suggested it could be a relatively common condition. Some estimates suggest nearly 1 in 20 people may be affected by fibromyalgia to some degree. One of the main reasons it's not clear how many people are affected is because fibromyalgia can be a difficult condition to diagnose. There's no specific test for the condition, and the symptoms can be similar to a number of other conditions."

You can take it at regular intervals, up to the recommended daily dose. If paracetamol does not work, try an oral NSAID painkiller such as ibuprofen . If it does not help stop using it. Stronger pain relief – you may be prescribed stronger painkillers or a steroid injection in your shoulder. Getting movement back – try gentle shoulder exercises at home. If the pain continues, you may be referred to a physiotherapist. You may get a mix of these treatments depending on how painful and stiff your shoulder is.

It's important to consider whether any medicine you're taking may be causing your symptoms – for example, taking painkillers long term can lead to headaches . The GP should also investigate whether you might have an associated problem, such as depression or anxiety. Physical symptoms can cause depression and anxiety, and these can in turn make the physical symptoms worse, creating a vicious circle. You should tell the GP: what your symptoms are like, when they started and what makes them better or worse what you think is the cause of your symptoms and your expectations of how tests and treatments might help how your symptoms affect what you can do – what they stop you doing how upsetting your symptoms are – how they make you feel There are a number of things you can do yourself that may help. You and the GP may identify some lifestyle changes and goals that you both think will help relieve your symptoms, such as regular physical activity and better rest. You may be referred for a talking therapy, such as cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) . The aim of CBT is to help you to manage your symptoms by enabling you to understand links between your symptoms, worries, feelings and how you cope. If your symptoms seem to be caused by a problem with the nervous system, you may be referred to a neurologist (a specialist in disorders of the nervous system). The neurologist may refer you for psychotherapy but will also consider other therapy options, such as physiotherapy or occupational therapy . Medicine such as antidepressants can be helpful, even if you're not depressed. However, medicine isn't always the answer – painkillers or sedatives, for example, may lead to dependence. The possible benefits of medicine always need to be weighed against the potential side effects. If you think you have an underlying condition that's been missed by your doctor, you can ask for a second opinion."

Your specialist eye doctor will advise you on how it may affect your sight, and how to live as independently as you can.

If you do have some sight loss, it can be difficult to come to terms with. You might find it helpful to contact a support group for people with sight loss.

If glomerulonephritis is mild, it does not usually cause any noticeable symptoms. It's more likely to be diagnosed when blood or urine tests are carried out for another reason. Although mild cases of glomerulonephritis can be treated effectively, for some people the condition can lead to long-term kidney problems."

Your pee may also be frothy if it contains a large amount of protein. If a lot of protein leaks into your urine, swelling of the legs or other parts of the body can also develop. This is known as nephrotic syndrome. Depending on the cause of glomerulonephritis, other parts of your body can be affected with symptoms such as: rashes joint pain stomach pain high temperature shortness of breath yellowing of the whites of the eyes or the skin, although this may be less noticeable on brown or black skin ( jaundice ) peeing a lot less than usual tiredness loss of appetite and weight loss Some people with glomerulonephritis also have high blood pressure ."

If the GP suspects glomerulonephritis, they'll usually arrange: blood tests – to check how much protein is in your blood and measure your creatinine level (creatinine is a waste product produced by your muscles) a urine test – to check for blood or protein in your pee If you do have glomerulonephritis, further blood tests may be needed to help find out the cause. If your kidney problem needs to be investigated further, other tests may be recommended, including: an ultrasound scan – this is to check the size of your kidneys, make sure there are no blockages, and look for any other problems a biopsy – this is to remove a small sample of kidney tissue, carried out using local anaesthetic to numb the area; an ultrasound machine locates your kidneys and a small needle is used to take a sample"

This build-up of iron, known as iron overload, can cause unpleasant symptoms. If it is not treated, this can damage parts of the body such as the liver, joints, pancreas and heart. Haemochromatosis most often affects people of white northern European background and is particularly common in countries where lots of people have a Celtic background, such as Ireland, Scotland and Wales."

Haemophilia is treated in 2 main ways: If you have severe haemophilia, you'll usually need injections up to 3 times a week to prevent bleeding (preventative or prophylactic treatment). You can usually do these injections yourself at home. If you have mild or moderate haemophilia, you'll usually only need treatment to stop or reduce bleeding after it starts (on-demand treatment). You may also need treatment before having surgery or dental work. Some people develop antibodies to clotting factor, called inhibitors, which make this treatment less effective. If this happens, your haemophilia team will work with you to find you a more suitable treatment. The clotting factor used to treat haemophilia today is very safe. Much of it's synthetic and has no risk of infection. When it's made from donated blood, it's tested and treated to make sure it's as safe as possible, and the risk of getting an infection from it is very low."

For the first 2 to 3 days, follow these 5 steps known as PRICE therapy: Protection – protect your leg from further injury. Rest – stop any exercise or activities and try not to put any weight on the injury. Ice – apply an ice pack (or a bag of frozen vegetables) wrapped in a tea towel to the injury for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours. Compression – use a tubular or standard elastic bandage around your injured leg (it should be snug but not tight); take it off before going to sleep. Elevate – keep your leg raised on a pillow as much as possible. To help prevent swelling, try to avoid heat (such as hot baths and heat packs), massages or drinking alcohol for the first 3 days. When you can move your leg without pain stopping you, try to keep moving it so your hamstring does not become stiff. Mild hamstring injuries usually get better in a few days."

It can also happen if you share things like needles, razor blades or toothbrushes, or from equipment that's not been cleaned properly – for example, when getting a tattoo or piercing.

Hepatitis B Passed on from infected blood or body fluids. Hepatitis B vaccine is part of the 6-in-1 vaccine offered to all babies in the UK. Hepatitis C Passed on from infected blood. Symptoms often only appear months or years after infection. Hepatitis D Passed on from infected blood or body fluids. Only people who have hepatitis B can get hepatitis D. Hepatitis E Usually caught in the UK from eating raw or undercooked meat or shellfish. In some parts of the world, it can be caught from contaminated food and water. Most people will get better without treatment, but it can make you seriously ill if you're pregnant or have a weakened immune system. Alcoholic hepatitis A stage of alcohol-related liver disease. Usually caused by liver damage from drinking too much alcohol over a long period of time. Can also happen if you regularly drink a lot of alcohol in a short period of time (binge drink). Autoimmune hepatitis Caused by your immune system attacking your own body. More common if you're a woman or have another autoimmune condition. You cannot catch or spread autoimmune hepatitis."

A tiny plug is inserted inside the artery supplying the abnormal blood vessel. Embolisation is preferred to open surgery and is normally carried out under sedation (which helps relax you during the procedure). For brain AVMs, embolisation, surgery and stereotactic radiotherapy (precisely delivering radiation to the blood vessel) are possible treatment options. Liver AVMs may require different types of specialist treatments. However, these treatments are not always appropriate.

This type of surgery is usually done using general anaesthetic , which means you're asleep while it’s carried out. During umbilical hernia repair surgery: Cuts are made in the skin near the hernia The hernia is gently pushed back into place. The gap in the muscles is closed by stitching the muscles together. For larger hernias, a surgical mesh may also be attached to the muscles to help hold them in place. The cuts in the skin are closed with stitches or clips and covered with a dressing. The surgery lasts between 30 and 60 minutes. Like any type of surgery, there is a small risk of complications. These include infection, blood clots and lasting pain. The hernia could also come back. It usually takes up to 4 to 6 weeks to fully recover from an umbilical hernia repair. You will probably need to stay off work for usually at least 1 to 2 weeks, or up to 6 weeks if your job involves heavy lifting. Your surgeon can give you more information about the risks and benefits of surgery, and what to expect during your recovery."

The following advice can reduce the risk of your baby getting infected by the herpes virus during this time. Everyone should wash their hands before handling your baby. Discourage anyone who is not a close family member or carer from kissing your baby. The safest place to kiss your baby is on the top of their head. Kissing your baby near their mouth, nose or eyes should be avoided. People with a current cold sore, or a recent history of cold sores, should not kiss your baby. People with a known herpes infection, such as a cold sore or herpes blister, should avoid touching your baby unless they are a close family member or carer, and in that case, they should carefully wash their hands first."

If your partner has herpes symptoms then you should use a condom during sex, especially in your 3rd trimester. You may need to take medicine during the 3rd trimester of your pregnancy to prevent an outbreak of vaginal sores during labour. Birth by caesarean section is recommended if the genital herpes has occurred for the first time in your 3rd trimester, particularly the last 6 weeks of your pregnancy. You may also need to take medicines after birth if you develop herpes blisters on your breasts.

If these are not controlled with medicine, larger lumps may develop and spread. Narrow channels called sinus tracts also form under the skin that break out on the surface and leak pus. Hidradenitis suppurativa can be very painful. The lumps develop on the skin in the following areas: around the groin and genitals in the armpits on the bottom and around the anus below the breasts The lumps may also appear on the nape of the neck, waistband and inner thighs. Some of the lumps may become infected with bacteria, causing a secondary infection that will need to be treated with antibiotics . Many people with hidradenitis suppurativa also develop a pilonidal sinus , which is a small hole or \"tunnel\" in the skin at the top of the buttocks, where they divide (the cleft)."

Smoking and obesity are both strongly associated with hidradenitis suppurativa, and if you're obese and/or smoke it will make your symptoms worse. Hidradenitis suppurativa usually starts around puberty, but it can occur at any age after puberty. This may suggest that sex hormones play a part. Many people with the condition also have acne and excessive hair growth (hirsutism) . In rare cases, hidradenitis suppurativa may be linked to Crohn's disease , particularly if it develops around the groin area and the skin near the anus. Crohn's disease is a long-term condition that causes the lining of the digestive system to become inflamed. Hidradenitis suppurativa runs in families in about 1 in 3 cases. It's not infectious and isn't linked to poor hygiene."

In Hirschsprung's disease, the nerves that control this movement are missing from a section at the end of the bowel, which means poo can build up and form a blockage. This can cause severe constipation and sometimes lead to a serious bowel infection called enterocolitis.

In adults, the first treatment is usually to drain the pee to help relieve pain and prevent damage to your kidneys. This is done by putting a thin tube (catheter) into your bladder, through either: your urethra (tube that carries urine out of your body) a small cut in your tummy (abdomen) Once the pee is drained, the cause can be treated. For example, you might need medicine to treat infection or surgery to remove a blockage. Antenatal hydronephrosis does not usually need any treatment. It often gets better on its own, either during the pregnancy or after your baby is born. If it does not get better on its own, babies and young children may be given antibiotics to prevent infection. They do not usually need other treatments."

Having too much of these hormones can cause unpleasant and potentially serious problems that may need treatment.

Types of surgery that carry this risk of damage include surgery for an underactive thyroid or overactive thyroid , and surgery for head or neck cancer .

Private treatment is also available, but it can be expensive and there's no guarantee it will be successful. It's important to choose a private clinic carefully. You can ask a GP for advice, and should make sure you choose a clinic that's licensed by the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA) . Some treatments for infertility, such as IVF, can cause complications. For example: multiple pregnancy – if more than 1 embryo is placed in the womb as part of IVF treatment there's an increased chance of having twins; this may not seem like a bad thing, but it significantly increases the risk of complications for you and your babies ectopic pregnancy – the risk of having an ectopic pregnancy is slightly increased if you have IVF Read more about how infertility is treated ."

You may be referred to a sleep clinic if you have symptoms of another sleep disorder such as sleep apnoea. GPs now rarely prescribe sleeping pills to treat insomnia. Sleeping pills can have serious side effects and you can become dependent on them.

Other symptoms of newborn jaundice can include: dark, yellow urine (a newborn baby's urine should be colourless) pale-coloured poo (it should be yellow or orange) The symptoms of newborn jaundice usually develop 2 days after the birth and tend to get better without treatment by the time the baby is about 2 weeks old. Find out more about the symptoms of jaundice in babies Your baby will be examined for signs of jaundice within 72 hours of being born as part of the newborn physical examination . If your baby develops signs of jaundice after this time, speak to your midwife, health visitor or a GP as soon as possible for advice. While jaundice is not usually a cause for concern, it's important to determine whether your baby needs treatment. If you're monitoring your baby's jaundice at home, it's also important to contact your midwife straight away if your baby's symptoms quickly get worse or they become very reluctant to feed.

                "text": "Jaundice is caused by the build-up of bilirubin in the blood. Bilirubin is a yellow substance produced when red blood cells, which carry oxygen around the body, are broken down. Jaundice is common in newborn babies because babies have a high number of red blood cells in their blood, which are broken down and replaced frequently. Also, a newborn baby's liver is not fully developed, so it's less effective at removing the bilirubin from the blood. By the time a baby is about 2 weeks old, their liver is more effective at processing bilirubin, so jaundice often corrects itself by this age without causing any harm. In a small number of cases, jaundice can be the sign of an underlying health condition. This is often the case if jaundice develops shortly after birth (within the first 24 hours)."

There are 2 main treatments that can be carried out in hospital to quickly reduce your baby's bilirubin levels. These are: phototherapy – a special type of light shines on the skin, which alters the bilirubin into a form that can be more easily broken down by the liver an exchange transfusion – where your baby's blood is removed using a thin tube (catheter) placed in their blood vessels and replaced with blood from a matching donor; most babies respond well to treatment and can leave hospital after a few days"

Chromosomes are packages of genes found in every cell in the body. There are 2 types of chromosome, called the sex chromosomes, that determine the genetic sex of a baby. These are named either X or Y. Usually, a female baby has 2 X chromosomes (XX) and a male has 1 X and 1 Y (XY). But in Klinefelter syndrome, a boy is born with an extra copy of the X chromosome (XXY). The X chromosome is not a \"female\" chromosome and is present in everyone. The presence of a Y chromosome denotes male sex. Boys and men with Klinefelter syndrome are still genetically male, and often will not realise they have this extra chromosome, but occasionally it can cause problems that may require treatment."

This chromosome carries extra copies of genes, which may interfere with the development of the testicles and mean they produce less testosterone (male sex hormone) than usual. The extra genetic information may either be carried in every cell in the body or it may only affect some cells (known as mosaic Klinefelter syndrome). Klinefelter syndrome is not directly inherited – the additional X chromosome occurs as a result of either the mother's egg or the father's sperm having the extra X chromosome (an equal chance of this happening in either), so after conception the chromosome pattern is XXY rather than XY. This change in the egg or sperm seems to happen randomly. If you have a son with the condition, the chances of this happening again are very small. The risk of a woman having a son with Klinefelter syndrome may be slightly higher if the mother or father are older."

Your GP may suspect Klinefelter syndrome after a physical examination and may suggest sending off a sample of blood to check reproductive hormone levels.

This can cause the inner lips of the vulva to become sticky. Without enough oestrogen in the body, which is quite normal before puberty, the lips can stay stuck together and gradually become firmly joined. The problem is rarely seen in girls after they begin puberty because this is when they start to produce the hormone oestrogen. Labial fusion can also sometimes happen after childbirth or after the menopause, when oestrogen levels are also low."

A doctor can usually gently pull them apart by hand, or by using a small blunt probe. A surgical separation is usually performed under a general anaesthetic , where you're asleep, or local anaesthetic , where the area is numbed, as the procedure can be quite painful and can cause distress. To allow the labial edges to heal properly and prevent another labial fusion forming, it's advised to apply an emollient, such as nappy rash cream or Vaseline, to the labia for a few weeks afterwards. There's a high chance the fusion will return after treatment, whether it's with oestrogen cream or surgery."

If the nerve endings are damaged, the amount of acetylcholine they produce decreases, which means nerve signals do not reach the muscles properly. It's not known what triggers the immune system to attack the nerves. It's often associated with lung cancer, but can occur in people without cancer."

The symptoms of a venous leg ulcer include pain, itching and swelling in the affected leg. There may also be discoloured or hardened skin around the ulcer, and the sore may produce a foul-smelling discharge. See your GP if you think you have a leg ulcer, as it'll need specialist treatment to help it heal. Your GP will examine your leg and may carry out additional tests to rule out other conditions.

But some ulcers may take longer to heal, and a very small number never heal. Treatment usually involves: cleaning and dressing the wound using compression, such as bandages or stockings, to improve the flow of blood in the legs Antibiotics may also be used if the ulcer becomes infected, but they do not help ulcers heal. But unless the underlying cause of the ulcer is addressed, there's a high risk of a venous leg ulcer coming back after treatment. Underlying causes could include immobility, obesity, previous DVT or varicose veins. Find out more about how venous leg ulcers are treated"

Both types of surgery are carried out while you are awake, using local anaesthetic, so you will not feel any pain. Laser eye surgery is where high-energy beams of light (lasers) are used to reshape the surface of the eye (the cornea) to correct the way your eye focuses. Lens surgery is where the lens inside your eye is replaced with a plastic implant to correct your vision. Ask your optician if laser or lens surgery may be options for you. These treatments are not usually available on the NHS. Find out more about laser eye surgery and lens surgery"

The rash can appear up to 3 months after being bitten by an infected tick, but usually appears within 1 to 4 weeks. It can last for several weeks. The rash can have a darker or lighter area in the centre and might gradually spread. It's not usually hot or itchy. The rash may be flat, or slightly raised, and look pink, red, or purple when it appears on white skin. It can be harder to see the rash on brown and black skin and it may look like a bruise.

As you get older, the vitreous jelly in the middle of your eye starts to pull away from the retina and macula at the back of the eye. If some of the vitreous jelly remains attached to the retina as it shrinks, it can pull a section of the retina away with it, leading to a macular hole. A few cases may be associated with: retinal detachment – when the retina begins to pull away from the blood vessels that supply it with oxygen and nutrients severe injury to the eye being slightly long-sighted (hyperopic) being very short-sighted (myopic) persistent swelling of the central retina (cystoid macular oedema)"

The eye is then filled with a temporary gas bubble, which presses the hole flat onto the back of the eye to help it seal. The bubble of gas will block the vision while it's present, but it slowly disappears. Macular hole surgery usually lasts about an hour and can be done while you're awake (under local anaesthetic) or asleep (under general anaesthetic) .

The hole may fail to close, but this normally won't have made your vision any worse, and it's usually possible to repeat the surgery. You'll almost certainly get a cataract after the surgery, usually within a year if you've not already had a cataract operation. This means the natural lens in your eye has gone cloudy. If you do already have a cataract, it may be removed at the same time the hole is being repaired. There's also a risk of retinal detachment , where the retina detaches from the back of the eye. This can potentially cause blindness, but it's usually repairable in a further operation. Bleeding occurs very rarely, but severe bleeding within the eye can result in blindness. Infection is another very rare complication. An infection needs further treatment and could lead to blindness. An increase in pressure within the eye is quite common in the days after macular hole surgery, usually due to the expanding gas bubble. In most cases, it's short lived and controlled with extra eye drops to reduce the pressure, protecting the eye from damage. If the high pressure is extreme or prolonged, there may be some damage to the optic nerve as a result."

The first dietary advice is usually to: eat \"fortified\" foods that are high in calories and protein snack between meals have drinks that contain lots of calories Some people also need support with underlying issues such as limited mobility. For example, care at home or occupational therapy . If a child is malnourished, their family or carers may need advice and support to address the underlying reasons why it happened. If these initial dietary changes are not enough, a doctor, nurse or dietitian may also suggest you take extra nutrients in the form of nutritional drinks or supplements. If you have difficulty eating and this cannot be managed by making changes such as eating soft or liquid foods, other treatments may be recommended, such as: a feeding tube – this can be either passed down your nose and into your stomach, or inserted directly into your stomach through the skin of the tummy nutrition that's given directly into a vein Read more about how malnutrition is treated ."

                "text": "Marfan syndrome is hereditary, which means it can be passed to a child from a parent who's affected. In around 3 in 4 cases, Marfan syndrome is inherited from 1 parent. The syndrome is autosomal dominant, which means a child can inherit it even if only 1 parent has the syndrome. There is therefore a 1 in 2 chance that the child of a parent with Marfan syndrome will inherit the syndrome. The gene defect leads to reduced production of a protein called fibrillin, resulting in parts of the body being able to stretch abnormally when placed under any kind of stress. The defective fibrillin gene also causes some bones to grow longer than they should. This means a person with Marfan syndrome may be tall because their arms and legs grow longer than normal. In the remaining 1 in 4 cases, neither parent has the syndrome. In these cases, the fibrillin gene changes (mutates) for the first time in the parent's egg or sperm. The mutated gene can be passed on to the child, who will then go on to develop the syndrome. Find out more about genetic inheritance"

The following tests are commonly used to look for systemic mastocytosis: blood tests – including a full blood count (FBC) and measuring blood tryptase levels an ultrasound scan to look for enlargement of the liver and spleen if it seems likely a DEXA scan to measure bone density a bone marrow biopsy test – where a local anaesthetic is used and a long needle is inserted through the skin into the bone underneath, usually in the pelvis A diagnosis of systemic mastocytosis is usually made by finding typical changes on a bone marrow biopsy."

As mesothelioma is often diagnosed at an advanced stage, treatment is usually focused on controlling the symptoms and prolonging life for as long as possible. This is known as palliative or supportive care . Possible treatments include: chemotherapy – this is the main treatment for mesothelioma and involves using medicine to help shrink the cancer radiotherapy – this involves using high-energy radiation to kill cancer cells; it may be used to slow the cancer down and keep it under control surgery – an operation to remove the cancerous area can be done if mesothelioma is detected at a very early stage, although it's not clear whether surgery is helpful immunotherapy – this involves using a combination of 2 medicines to help stimulate the immune system to attack cancer cells; immunotherapy cannot cure mesothelioma, but it can slow the spread of the disease and prolong lifespan You'll also probably have treatment for your individual symptoms to help you feel as comfortable as possible. For example, regularly draining fluid from your chest may help your breathing and strong painkillers may help relieve your pain. Sometimes, a procedure is carried out to stop the fluid coming back by making the outside of the lungs stick to the inside of your chest (pleurodesis), or a tube is put in your chest to drain the fluid regularly at home. Your doctors should discuss these treatments with you."

A rash usually appears 1 to 5 days after the first symptoms. It can be on any part of the body, including the palms of the hands, soles of the feet, mouth, genitals and anus. You may also have anal pain or bleeding from your bottom. The rash is sometimes confused with chickenpox . It starts as raised spots, which turn into sores (ulcers) or small blisters filled with fluid. The blisters eventually form scabs which later fall off. The symptoms usually clear up in a few weeks.

In myasthenia gravis, the immune system damages the communication system between the nerves and muscles, making the muscles weak and easily tired. It's not clear why this happens, but it's been linked to issues with the thymus gland (a gland in the chest that's part of the immune system). Many people with myasthenia gravis have a thymus gland that's larger than normal. Around 1 in 10 people have an abnormal growth of the thymus called a thymoma."

In an attempt to avoid attacks, some people may become emotionally withdrawn and socially isolated. Find out more about the symptoms of narcolepsy ."

This may be difficult when you're at work or school, but a GP or specialist may be able to devise a sleep schedule that will help you get into a routine of taking naps. Keeping to a strict bedtime routine can also help, so you should go to bed at the same time each night whenever possible.

This may involve examining your throat using a small mirror and a light. The GP will refer you to a head and neck cancer specialist (oncologist) if they think further tests are necessary. At hospital, a number of different tests may be carried out to check for nasopharyngeal cancer and rule out other conditions. Some of the tests you may have include: a nasendoscopy – a thin, flexible telescope (endoscope) is put in your nose and passed down your throat to look for any abnormalities; you're usually conscious but local anaesthetic can be used to numb your nose and throat imaging scans – MRI scans , CT scans or PET-CT scans can be used to look for tumours and check if the cancer has spread a panendoscopy – a more detailed examination of your nose and throat carried out under general anaesthetic (where you're unconscious) using a series of small, rigid telescopes connected together a biopsy – where a small tissue sample is removed during a panendoscopy so it can be examined in a laboratory Once these tests are complete, your doctors will be able to confirm whether you have nasopharyngeal cancer. They'll also be able to \"stage\" the cancer, which means giving it a score to describe how large it is and how far it's spread.

The 2 main treatments for nasopharyngeal cancer are: radiotherapy – where radiation is used to kill cancer cells chemotherapy – where medicine is used to kill cancer cells A combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy is often used. Surgery isn't usually used to treat nasopharyngeal cancer because it's difficult for surgeons to access the affected area. If you smoke, it's important you give up.

It can be used on its own to treat very early-stage cancers, or in combination with chemotherapy for more advanced cancers. Most of the time, external radiotherapy is used. A machine focuses high-energy radiation beams on to the area that requires treatment. In nasopharyngeal cancer, an advanced form of external radiotherapy called intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is used. It involves aiming radiation beams of different strengths at a tumour from several different angles. This maximises the dose delivered to the tumour, while minimising the effect on the surrounding healthy tissue. Stereotactic radiotherapy is another way of giving radiotherapy externally and may be used to target a specific area where the cancer has returned. External radiotherapy is often given in short sessions, once a day from Monday to Friday, with a break at weekends. This is usually carried out for up to 7 weeks. You won't need to stay in hospital overnight between these appointments."

Swelling is usually first noticed around the eyes, then around the lower legs and the rest of the body. infections – antibodies are a specialised group of proteins in the blood that help to fight infection. When these are lost, children are much more likely to get infections. urine changes – occasionally, the high levels of protein being passed into the urine can cause it to become frothy. Some children with nephrotic syndrome may also pass less urine than usual during relapses. blood clots – important proteins that help prevent the blood clotting can be passed out in the urine of children with nephrotic syndrome. This can increase their risk of potentially serious blood clots . During a relapse, the blood also becomes more concentrated, which can lead to clotting."

Children with NF1 should have their eyes checked every year (adults every 2 years). Blood pressure should be checked every year. Children with NF1 often have learning difficulties and may need extra help and support at school. As the condition gets gradually worse and can cause serious problems, it can affect life expectancy.

For example, when: the mother has diabetes the baby is underweight the baby's lungs have not developed properly Around half of all babies born between 28 and 32 weeks of pregnancy develop NRDS.

You may have a steroid injection before your baby is delivered. A second dose is usually given 24 hours after the first. The steroids stimulate the development of the baby's lungs. It's estimated that the treatment helps prevent NRDS in a third of premature births. You may also be offered magnesium sulphate to reduce the risk of developmental problems linked to being born early. If you take magnesium sulphate for more than 5 to 7 days or several times during your pregnancy, your newborn baby may be offered extra checks. This is because prolonged use of magnesium sulphate in pregnancy has in rare cases been linked to bone problems in newborn babies."

It's usually given through an incubator, a small mask over their nose or face or tubes into their nose. If symptoms are more severe, your baby will be attached to a breathing machine (ventilator) to either support or take over their breathing. These treatments are often started immediately in the delivery room before transfer to the neonatal unit. Your baby may also be given a dose of artificial surfactant, usually through a breathing tube. Evidence suggests early treatment within 2 hours of delivery is more beneficial than if treatment is delayed. They'll also be given fluids and nutrition through a tube connected to a vein. Some babies with NRDS only need help with breathing for a few days. But some, usually those born extremely prematurely, may need support for weeks or even months. Premature babies often have multiple problems that keep them in hospital, but generally they're well enough to go home around their original expected delivery date. The length of time your baby needs to stay in hospital will depend on how early they were born."

The lymphatic system is part of your immune system. Clear fluid called lymph flows through the lymphatic vessels and contains infection-fighting white blood cells known as lymphocytes. In non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the affected lymphocytes start to multiply in an abnormal way and begin to collect in certain parts of the lymphatic system, such as the lymph nodes (glands). The affected lymphocytes lose their infection-fighting properties, making you more vulnerable to infection. The most common symptom of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a painless swelling in a lymph node, usually in the neck, armpit or groin. Find out more about the symptoms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma"

Low-grade tumours do not necessarily require immediate medical treatment, but are harder to completely cure. High-grade lymphomas need to be treated straight away, but tend to respond much better to treatment and can often be cured. The main treatments used for non-Hodgkin lymphoma are: chemotherapy radiotherapy a targeted treatment called monoclonal antibody therapy Overall, most cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are considered very treatable. You can read more detailed information about the outlook for non-Hodgkin lymphoma on the Cancer Research UK website . But there's a risk of long-term problems after treatment, including infertility and an increased risk of developing another type of cancer in the future."

This involves having a blood test to check for one of the altered genes that causes the condition.

To calculate your waist to height ratio: Find the middle point between your lowest rib and your hip bone. This should be roughly level with your belly button. Wrap the tape measure around this middle point, breathing naturally and not holding your tummy in. Take your measurement and divide it by your height, measured in the same units (for example, centimetres or inches). For example, if your waist is 80cm and you are 160cm tall, you would calculate your result like this: 80 divided by 160, which equals 0.5.

Obesity and overweight is caused when extra calories, particularly those from foods high in fat and sugar, are stored in the body as fat. Obesity is an increasingly common problem because the environment we live in makes it difficult for many people to eat healthily and do enough physical activity. Genetics can also be a cause of obesity for some people. Your genes can affect how your body uses food and stores fat. There are also some underlying health conditions that can occasionally contribute to weight gain, such as an underactive thyroid gland (hypothyroidism) , although these types of conditions do not usually cause weight problems if they're effectively controlled with medicines. Some medicines can also make people more likely to put on weight, including steroids and some medicines for high blood pressure, diabetes or mental health conditions."

Your GP can tell you about these. You may also benefit from receiving support and counselling from a trained healthcare professional to help you better understand your relationship with food and develop different eating habits. If you're living with obesity and lifestyle and behavioural changes alone do not help you lose weight, a medicine called orlistat may be recommended. If taken correctly, this medicine works by reducing the amount of fat you absorb during digestion. Your GP will know whether orlistat is suitable for you. A specialist may prescribe other medicines called liraglutide, semaglutide or tirzepatide. They work by making you feel fuller and less hungry. For some people living with obesity, a specialist may recommend weight loss surgery ."

Tests to check for the condition will be carried out after your baby is born, if they seem to be having problems swallowing or breathing.

They'll receive nutrition into a vein (intravenously) and a suction tube will be used to remove fluid from the pouch in their oesophagus. The surgeon makes a cut on the right side of the chest, between the ribs, and closes off the abnormal connection (fistula) between the oesophagus and windpipe. They'll then sew together the upper and lower parts of the oesophagus. If the gap in the oesophagus is large, your child may need to wait a few months for the operation, to allow their oesophagus to grow a bit more. A similar wait may be recommended if they have an oesophageal atresia but they don’t have a tracheo-oesophageal fistula. During this time, they'll need to have a feeding tube temporarily placed into their stomach through their tummy. Occasionally, a procedure to lengthen the oesophagus before repairing it may be carried out."

For some people, the symptoms can be mild and may come and go. Other people can experience more continuous and severe problems which make it difficult to carry out everyday activities. Almost any joint can be affected by osteoarthritis, but the condition most often causes problems in the knees, hips and small joints of the hands.

But in osteoarthritis, the protective cartilage on the ends of your bones breaks down, causing pain, swelling and problems moving the joint. Bony growths can develop, and the area can become swollen and red. (Redness can be harder to see on brown and black skin.) The exact cause is not known, but several things are thought to increase your risk of developing osteoarthritis, including: joint injury – overusing your joint when it has not had enough time to heal after an injury or operation other conditions (secondary arthritis) – osteoarthritis can happen in joints severely damaged by a previous or existing condition, such as rheumatoid arthritis or gout age – your risk of developing the condition increases as you get older family history – osteoarthritis may run in families, although studies have not identified a single gene responsible obesity – being obese puts excess strain on your joints, particularly those that bear most of your weight, such as your knees and hips being a woman – osteoarthritis is more common in women than men"

For example, prolonged joint stiffness in the morning can be a sign of rheumatoid arthritis . Further tests – such as X-rays or blood tests – are not usually necessary, but may be used to rule out other possible causes, such as rheumatoid arthritis or a fractured bone."

It develops slowly over several years and is often only diagnosed when a fall or sudden impact causes a bone to break (fracture). The most common injuries in people with osteoporosis are: broken wrist broken hip ( hip fracture ) broken spinal bones (vertebrae) However, breaks can also happen in other bones, such as in the arm or pelvis. Sometimes a cough or sneeze can cause a broken rib or the partial collapse of one of the bones of the spine. Osteoporosis is not usually painful until a bone is broken, but broken bones in the spine are a common cause of long-term pain. Although a broken bone is often the first sign of osteoporosis, some older people develop the characteristic stooped (bent forward) posture. It happens when the bones in the spine have broken, making it difficult to support the weight of the body. Osteoporosis can be treated with bone strengthening medicines."

                "text": "Paget's disease of the nipple always starts in the nipple and may extend to the areola. It appears as a red, scaly rash on the skin of the nipple and areola. The affected skin is often sore and inflamed, and it can be itchy or cause a burning sensation. The nipple can sometimes be ulcerated. CID, ISM /SCIENCE PHOTO LIBRARY https://www.sciencephoto.com/media/459439/view The rash is often similar in appearance to other skin conditions, such as eczema or psoriasis . If you scratch it, or if it's left untreated, it can bleed, become ulcerated or scab over. If you're experiencing itchiness, burning or bleeding but the nipple looks normal and is not red or scaly, it's unlikely to be Paget's disease of the nipple. However, you should still have it checked by a doctor. Around half of all women diagnosed with Paget's disease of the nipple have a lump behind the nipple. In 9 out of 10 cases this is an invasive breast cancer. Invasive cancer is where cancerous cells invade the surrounding breast tissue. Some women with Paget's disease have invasive breast cancer but do not have a lump. However, most women with Paget's disease who do not have a lump have non-invasive cancer. This is where the cancerous cells are contained in 1 or more areas of the breast and have not spread."

As Paget's disease of the nipple is associated with breast cancer, the sooner it's diagnosed, the better the outcome is likely to be. Also see your GP if you develop a lump in your breast. Although most breast lumps are not cancerous, it's important to have them checked out. A biopsy is used to confirm a suspected diagnosis of Paget's disease of the nipple. A small tissue sample (punch biopsy of the skin) will be taken from your nipple and examined under a microscope to see if it's cancerous. If the results of the biopsy indicate Paget's disease, you'll have a mammogram (a low-dose breast X-ray ) to investigate further. Read more about diagnosing Paget's disease of the nipple ."

Depending on whether the cancer has spread, surgery will either involve removing the whole breast (a mastectomy ), or the nipple and areola with the breast tissue underneath them (a central excision). If the whole of your breast is removed, breast reconstruction surgery can be used to create a breast shape to match your remaining breast. You may also need further treatment if you have invasive breast cancer. This may be a combination of: chemotherapy – where powerful medicine is used to destroy cancerous cells radiotherapy – where controlled doses of high-energy radiation are used to destroy cancerous cells targeted or hormone therapy – which lowers the risk of cancer returning in the same breast (and affecting the other breast), and it lowers the risk of cancerous cells spreading elsewhere in the body If Paget's disease is detected and treated in its early stages, there's a good chance of a full recovery.

Each cell normally contains 23 pairs of chromosomes, which carry the genes you inherit from your parents. But a baby with Patau's syndrome has 3 copies of chromosome 13, instead of 2. This severely disrupts normal development and, in many cases, results in miscarriage , stillbirth or the baby dying shortly after birth. Babies with Patau's syndrome grow slowly in the womb and have a low birth weight, along with a number of other serious medical problems. Patau's syndrome affects about 1 in every 4,000 births. The risk of having a baby with the syndrome increases with the mother's age. More than 9 out of 10 children born with Patau's syndrome die during the first year."

They happen randomly during conception, when the sperm and egg combine and the foetus starts to develop. There's an error when the cells divide, resulting in an additional copy, or part of a copy, of chromosome 13, which severely affects the baby's development in the womb. In many cases, the baby dies before reaching full term (miscarriage) or is dead at birth (stillbirth) . In most cases of Patau's syndrome, a baby has a whole extra copy of chromosome number 13 in their body's cells. This is sometimes known as trisomy 13 or simple trisomy 13. In some cases of Patau's syndrome, genetic material is rearranged between chromosome 13 and another chromosome. This is called a chromosomal translocation. Patau's syndrome that arises because of this can be inherited. Sometimes only some cells have the extra copy of chromosome 13. This is known as trisomy 13 mosaicism. Occasionally, only part of 1 chromosome 13 is extra (partial trisomy 13). The symptoms and features of both mosaicism and partial trisomy tend to be less severe than in simple trisomy 13, resulting in more babies living longer.

The test assesses your chances of having a baby with these syndromes. The screening test offered at 10 to 14 weeks of pregnancy is called the combined test because it involves a blood test and an ultrasound scan . If the screening tests show you have a higher chance of having a baby with Patau's syndrome, you'll be offered a second screening test called non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). This is a blood test that can give you a more accurate screening result and help you to decide whether to have a diagnostic test or not. It's available free on the NHS. A diagnostic test will check the chromosomes in a sample of cells taken from your baby and helps to find out for certain if they have Patau's syndrome. Two techniques can be used to obtain the cell sample: amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling (CVS) . These are invasive tests to remove a sample of tissue or fluid so it can be tested for the presence of the extra copy of chromosome 13. If you're not able to have the combined screening test, you'll be offered a scan that looks for physical abnormalities, including those found in Patau's syndrome. This is sometimes called the mid-pregnancy scan and is carried out when you're between 18 and 21 weeks pregnant.

The main treatment is antibiotics. The doctor will usually give you an injection of antibiotics, and prescribe antibiotic tablets for you to take for 2 weeks. If you're in pain, taking an everyday painkiller such as paracetamol or ibuprofen can help. If the GP thinks your symptoms were caused by a sexually transmitted infection (STI), you may be referred to a sexual health clinic. The sexual health clinic will also contact your recent sexual partners to ask them to get tested. You'll be advised to stop having sex until: you and your sexual partners have finished any antibiotics you no longer have symptoms your test results show the infection has gone If you do have sex, you should use a condom ."

You can ask for this examination to be done by a female doctor if you prefer. You may be asked to lie on your side with your knees pulled up towards your chest or you may be examined standing up. The doctor will feel for any lumps in your pelvic area and inside your vagina. They may gently put a smooth, tube-shaped tool called a speculum into your vagina so they can see if there's a prolapse. If you have problems with your bladder, the GP may refer you to hospital for further tests. If you're diagnosed with a prolapse, it may be given a number from 1 to 4 depending on how severe it is, with 4 being a severe prolapse."

Some cases may improve with time if the underlying cause is treated, whereas in some people the damage may be permanent or may get gradually worse with time. If the underlying cause of peripheral neuropathy is not treated, you may be at risk of developing potentially serious complications, such as a foot ulcer that becomes infected. This can lead to gangrene if untreated, and in severe cases may mean the foot has to be amputated. Peripheral neuropathy may affect the nerves controlling the automatic functions of the heart and circulation system (cardiovascular autonomic neuropathy). You may need treatment to increase your blood pressure or, in rare cases, a pacemaker . Find out more about complications of peripheral neuropathy"

You can contact your GP surgery to check if you, or your child, are up to date with your polio vaccinations. For children and babies, you can also check their personal child health record (red book). If you are not up to date, book an appointment with your GP surgery to get vaccinated free on the NHS. You can have a polio vaccination at any point if you've never had one before, even if you're not travelling to a country with a risk of getting polio. You should also get vaccinated even if you've had polio before as it protects against different types of polio."

Your chance of getting polio in the UK is extremely low. This is because most people are fully vaccinated. Polio was eradicated in Europe in 2003. There's still an extremely small risk of catching it when travelling in a country where polio is still found, such as Afghanistan and Pakistan. If you're not vaccinated, there is also a very small risk of getting it through contact with a person bringing the polio virus from these countries when they return to the UK.

This contributes to the increased production and activity of hormones like testosterone. Being overweight or obese also increases the amount of insulin your body produces."

If you have PCOS and you're overweight, losing weight and eating a healthy, balanced diet can make some symptoms better. Medicines are also available to treat symptoms such as excessive hair growth, irregular periods and fertility problems. If fertility medicines are not effective, a simple surgical procedure called laparoscopic ovarian drilling (LOD) may be recommended. This involves using heat or a laser to destroy the tissue in the ovaries that's producing androgens, such as testosterone. With treatment, most women with PCOS are able to get pregnant."

This includes managing the person's excessive appetite and behavioural challenges. One of the most important parts of caring for someone with Prader-Willi syndrome is to try to maintain a normal weight. They should have a healthy, balanced diet, avoiding sweet treats and high-calorie items right from the start. If someone with Prader-Willi syndrome is allowed to eat as much as they want, they'll quickly become dangerously overweight. Someone with the syndrome can eat much more than other people and still feel hungry. Limiting food intake can be very challenging. People with Prader-Willi syndrome may become frustrated when they want extra food, and their hunger can make them hide or steal food. Read more about managing Prader-Willi syndrome ."

Many adults with Prader-Willi syndrome take part in activities such as voluntary or part-time work but it's unlikely they'll be able to live fully independent lives. The increased appetite also means there's a higher risk of choking on food, so carers are advised to learn what to do if someone is choking ."

It's not clear why this happens, but it's thought to be caused by a combination of subtle differences in how the immune system works. The bile ducts become damaged and injured, causing bile to build up in the liver. This further damages the liver and may lead to scarring ( cirrhosis )."

The amount of abnormal tau in the brain can vary among people with PSP, as can the location of these clumps. This means the condition can have a wide range of symptoms. The condition has been linked to changes in certain genes, but these genetic faults aren't inherited and the risk to other family members, including the children or siblings of someone with PSP, is very low."

Your doctor will try to rule out other conditions that can cause similar symptoms, such as Parkinson's disease. The large number of possible symptoms of PSP also makes it difficult to diagnose correctly and can mean it takes a while to get a definitive diagnosis. You may need to have a brain scan to look for other possible causes of your symptoms, as well as tests of your memory, concentration and ability to understand language. The diagnosis must be made or confirmed by a consultant with expertise in PSP. This will usually be a neurologist (a specialist in conditions affecting the brain and nerves).

On brown, black and white skin the patches can look pink or red, and the scales white or silvery. On brown and black skin the patches can also look purple or dark brown, and the scales may look grey. These patches normally appear on your elbows, knees, scalp and lower back, but can appear anywhere on your body. Most people are only affected with small patches. In some cases, the patches can be itchy or sore. Psoriasis affects around 2 in 100 people in the UK. It can start at any age, but most often develops in adults between 20 and 30 years old and between 50 and 60 years old. It affects men and women equally. The severity of psoriasis varies greatly from person to person. For some it's just a minor irritation, but for others it can have a big impact on their quality of life. Psoriasis is a long-lasting (chronic) disease that usually involves periods when you have no symptoms or mild symptoms, followed by periods when symptoms are more severe."

Skin cells are normally made and replaced every 3 to 4 weeks, but in psoriasis this process only takes about 3 to 7 days. The resulting build-up of skin cells is what creates the patches associated with psoriasis. Although the process is not fully understood, it's thought to be related to a problem with the immune system. The immune system is your body's defence against disease and infection, but it attacks healthy skin cells by mistake in people with psoriasis. Psoriasis can run in families, although the exact role genetics plays in causing psoriasis is unclear. Many people's psoriasis symptoms start or become worse because of a certain event, known as a trigger. Possible triggers of psoriasis include an injury to your skin, throat infections and using certain medicines. The condition is not contagious, so it cannot be spread from person to person."

You may be referred to a specialist in diagnosing and treating skin conditions (dermatologist) if your doctor is uncertain about your diagnosis, or if your condition is severe. In rare cases, a small sample of skin called a biopsy will be sent to the laboratory for examination under a microscope. If your doctor suspects you have psoriatic arthritis, which is sometimes a complication of psoriasis, you may be referred to a doctor who specialises in arthritis (rheumatologist). You may have blood tests to rule out other conditions, such as rheumatoid arthritis , and X-rays of the affected joints may be taken."

In most cases, the first treatment used will be a topical treatment, such as vitamin D analogues or topical corticosteroids . Topical treatments are creams and ointments applied to the skin. If these are not effective, or your condition is more severe, a treatment called phototherapy may be used. Phototherapy involves exposing your skin to certain types of ultraviolet light. In severe cases, where the above treatments are ineffective, systemic treatments may be used. These are oral or injected medicines that work throughout the whole body."

The reduced blood flow makes it harder for the right side of the heart to pump blood through the arteries. If the right side of your heart has to continually work harder, it can gradually become weaker. This can lead to heart failure .

The MECP2 gene contains instructions for producing a particular protein (MeCP2), which is needed for brain development. The gene abnormality prevents nerve cells in the brain from working properly. There's usually no family history of Rett syndrome, which means it's not passed on from one generation to the next. Almost all cases (over 99%) are spontaneous, with the mutation occurring randomly."

A genetic blood test can be used to identify if the genetic mutation is responsible for Rett syndrome.

As a parent caring for a child with the syndrome, it's likely you'll need help and support from a wide range of healthcare professionals. Your child may benefit from some of the following treatments and aids: speech and language therapy, picture boards, eye gaze technology and other visual aids to help with communication, or ways to help them communicate such as Signalong, Makaton or PECS medicine for breathing and mobility problems, and anti-epileptic medicine to control seizures physiotherapy , attention to mobility, careful attention to your child's sitting posture (to minimise the chances of scoliosis developing), and frequent changes in posture if scoliosis does become established, a back brace and sometimes spinal surgery may be used to prevent the spine curving further (read more about treating scoliosis ) a high-calorie, low carbohydrate (ketogenic) diet to help maintain sufficient weight and help control seizures, with the use of a feeding tube and other feeding aids if necessary occupational therapy to help develop the skills needed for dressing, feeding and other daily activities an ankle-foot orthosis (lower leg brace) to help them walk independently a hand splint to help control severe hand movements (they're mainly used for limited periods to prevent self-injury or to encourage activities with the other hand) Therapeutic horse riding, swimming, hydrotherapy and music therapy have also been reported to be beneficial. Ask your healthcare team where you can access these therapies. From the age of 14, people with Rett syndrome should have checks with their GP at least once a year.

The mother must have also been previously sensitised to RhD positive blood. Sensitisation happens when a woman with RhD negative blood is exposed to RhD positive blood, usually during a previous pregnancy with an RhD positive baby. The woman’s body responds to the RhD positive blood by producing antibodies (infection-fighting molecules) that recognise the foreign blood cells and destroy them. If sensitisation occurs, the next time the woman is exposed to RhD positive blood, her body produces antibodies immediately. If she's pregnant with an RhD positive baby, the antibodies can cross the placenta, causing rhesus disease in the unborn baby. The antibodies can continue attacking the baby's red blood cells for a few months after birth. Read more about the causes of rhesus disease ."

This anti-D immunoglobulin helps to remove the RhD foetal blood cells before they can cause sensitisation. If a woman has developed anti-D antibodies in a previous pregnancy (she's already sensitised) then these immunoglobulin injections don't help.

In some cases, doctors may want to examine the inside of your lungs using a long, thin, flexible tube with a light source and a camera at the end (an endoscope ) that's passed down your throat. A small sample of lung tissue may also be removed during this test so it can be studied under a microscope. This is known as a biopsy .

This helps relieve symptoms and prevent damage to affected organs by reducing inflammation and preventing scarring. However, steroid tablets can cause side effects such as weight gain and mood swings if taken in high doses. Other side effects, such as weakening of the bones ( osteoporosis ), can also develop if steroids are taken for a long time. Therefore, they're only used when necessary. You may initially be given a high dose of steroid medicine for a short period of time, before switching to a low dose for the months or years that follow. Your condition will be monitored during this time to see how well the treatment is working. In some cases, taking calcium or vitamin D supplements can help reduce the risk of osteoporosis caused by long-term use of steroid medicine. However, you should only take these if advised to by a doctor. Some people with sarcoidosis may have an increased risk of developing complications, including kidney stones, while taking steroid medicine. Other medicines may sometimes be used if steroids are not enough or there are concerns about side effects. In these cases, a medicine called an immunosuppressant might be recommended. This may help to improve your symptoms by reducing the activity of your immune system."

It responds like this to anything in the body it doesn't recognise, and settles down when the infection has been cleared. It's thought scleroderma occurs because part of the immune system has become overactive and out of control. This leads to cells in the connective tissue producing too much collagen, causing scarring and thickening (fibrosis) of the tissue. It's not clear why this happens.

If the GP suspects scoliosis they should refer you to a specialist. If you're diagnosed with scoliosis, they will discuss treatment options with you. An X-ray of your back will be carried out to check how big the curve is. You can find a specialist scoliosis centre by contacting Scoliosis Support & Research: Scoliosis Support & Research: Support"

Many people will not need any treatment and only a small number will need to have surgery on their spine. Babies and toddlers may not need treatment as the curve might improve over time. A plaster cast or plastic brace may be fitted to their back to stop the curve getting worse as they grow. Older children may wear a back brace to stop the curve getting worse until they stop growing. Sometimes surgery may be needed to control the growth of the spine until an operation to straighten it can be done when they stop growing. Adults may need treatment to relieve pain, such as painkillers, spinal injections and, very occasionally, surgery. It's not clear whether back exercises help improve scoliosis, but general exercise is good for overall health and should not be avoided unless advised by your doctor.

Idiopathic scoliosis cannot be prevented and is not thought to be linked to things such as bad posture, exercise or diet. Your genes may make you more likely to get it though, as it sometimes runs in families. Less commonly, scoliosis may be caused by: the bones in the spine not forming properly in the womb – this is called congenital scoliosis and is present from birth an underlying nerve or muscle condition, such as cerebral palsy or muscular dystrophy – this is called neuromuscular scoliosis wear and tear of the spine with age – this is called degenerative scoliosis, which affects older adults Scoliosis Support & Research has more information about the different types of scoliosis."

In rare cases shingles can cause pain without a rash. Usually you get the shingles rash on your chest and tummy, but it can appear anywhere on your body including on your face, eyes and genitals. The rash appears as blotches on your skin, on 1 side of your body only. A rash on both the left and right of your body is unlikely to be shingles.

Silica is a substance naturally found in certain types of stone, rock, sand and clay. Working with these materials can create a very fine dust that can be easily inhaled. Once inside the lungs, it causes swelling (inflammation) and gradually leads to areas of hardened and scarred lung tissue (fibrosis). Lung tissue that's scarred in this way doesn't function properly. People who work in the following industries are particularly at risk: stone masonry and stone cutting – especially with sandstone construction and demolition – as a result of exposure to concrete and paving materials worktop manufacturing and fitting pottery, ceramics and glass manufacturing mining and quarrying sand blasting"

Ice – apply an ice pack (or a bag of frozen vegetables wrapped in a tea towel) to the injury for up to 20 minutes every 2 to 3 hours. Compression – wrap a bandage around the injury to support it during the day. Elevate – keep it raised on a pillow as much as possible. To help prevent swelling, try to avoid heat (such as hot baths and heat packs), alcohol and massages for the first couple of days. When you can move the injured area without pain stopping you, try to keep moving it so the joint or muscle does not become stiff."

Surgery – this involves moving the muscles that control eye movement so the eyes line up correctly. It may be recommended if glasses are not fully effective on their own. Read more about squint surgery . Injections into the eye muscles – these weaken the eye muscles, which can help the eyes line up better. But the effect usually lasts less than 3 months.

When every part of this system works well, the right words are spoken in the right order, with correct rhythm, pauses and emphasis. A child learning to construct simple sentences needs practice to develop the different speech areas in the brain and create the \"wiring\" (neural pathways) needed for the different parts to work well together. Stammering can happen if some parts of this developing system are not co-ordinated. This can cause repetitions and stoppages, particularly when the child has lots to say, is excited, or feels under pressure. As the brain continues to develop, stammering may resolve or the brain can compensate, which is why many children stop stammering as they get older."

This can make them very anaemic (tired, short of breath and pale). It mainly affects people of Mediterranean, south Asian, southeast Asian and Middle Eastern origin. There are different types of thalassaemia, which can be divided into alpha and beta thalassaemias. Beta thalassaemia major is the most severe type. Other types include beta thalassaemia intermedia, alpha thalassaemia major and haemoglobin H disease. It's also possible to be a \"carrier\" of thalassaemia, also known as having the thalassaemia trait.

The eggs can survive up to 2 weeks. The larvae hatch from the eggs in your gut after you swallow them, and take 1 to 2 months to mature into threadworms. Children can get threadworms again after they've been treated for them if they get the eggs in their mouth. This is why it's important to encourage children to wash their hands regularly."

This can happen if: your skin is irritated or damaged you're taking antibiotics you have poorly controlled diabetes you have a weakened immune system (for example, because of HIV or chemotherapy) you're having hormone replacement therapy (HRT) you're pregnant"

You should be referred to see a specialist within 24 hours of the onset of your symptoms. A TIA is a warning sign that you may be at risk of having a full stroke in the near future, and an assessment can help doctors determine the best way to reduce the chances of that happening. If you think you may have had a TIA previously, but the symptoms have passed and you did not seek medical advice at the time, make an urgent appointment with a GP.

In most cases, trigeminal neuralgia affects just one side of the face, with the pain usually felt in the lower part of the face. Very occasionally the pain can affect both sides of the face, although not usually at the same time.

The compression of the trigeminal nerve is usually caused by a nearby blood vessel pressing on part of the nerve inside the skull. Trigeminal neuralgia can also happen when the trigeminal nerve is damaged by another medical condition, such as multiple sclerosis (MS) or a tumour. The attacks of pain are usually brought on by activities that involve lightly touching the face, such as washing, eating and brushing the teeth, but they can also be triggered by wind – even a slight breeze or air conditioning – or movement of the face or head. Sometimes the pain can happen without a trigger. Read more about the causes of trigeminal neuralgia ."

                "text": "Trigeminal neuralgia is usually a long-term condition and the periods of remission often get shorter over time. However, the treatments available do help most cases to some degree. An anticonvulsant medicine called carbamazepine , which is often used to treat epilepsy , is the first treatment usually recommended to treat trigeminal neuralgia. Carbamazepine can relieve nerve pain by slowing down electrical impulses in the nerves and reducing their ability to transmit pain messages. Carbamazepine needs to be taken several times a day to be effective, with the dose gradually increased over the course of a few days or weeks so high enough levels of the medicine can build up in your bloodstream. Unless your pain becomes much better, or disappears, the medicine is usually continued for as long as necessary, which could be for many years. If you're entering a period of remission, where your pain goes away, stopping carbamazepine should always be done slowly, over days or weeks, unless a doctor tells you otherwise. If this medicine does not help you, causes too many side effects, or you're unable to take it, you may be referred to a specialist to discuss alternative medicines or surgical procedures that may help. There are a number of minor surgical procedures that can be used to treat trigeminal neuralgia – usually by damaging the nerve to stop it sending pain signals – but these are generally only effective for a few years. Alternatively, your specialist may recommend having surgery to open your skull and move any blood vessels that are compressing the trigeminal nerve. Research suggests this operation offers the best results for long-term pain relief, but it's a major operation and carries a risk of potentially serious complications, such as hearing loss , facial numbness or, very rarely, a stroke .

In most people, this is achieved by taking medicine, such as: aminosalicylates (ASAs) corticosteroids (steroid medicines) immunosuppressants Mild to moderate flare-ups can usually be treated at home. But more severe flare-ups need to be treated in hospital. If medicines are not effective at controlling your symptoms or your quality of life is significantly affected by your condition, surgery to remove some or all of your bowel (colon) may be an option. During surgery, your small intestine can be diverted out of an opening in your abdomen known as a stoma. This type of surgery is known as an ileostomy. In some cases, the stoma is only temporary and can be closed up once your bowel has healed. An alternative option is to create an internal pouch that's connected to your anus called an ileoanal pouch. Read more about treating ulcerative colitis"

                "text": "If you're referred to a specialist they'll usually do a test called duplex ultrasound to confirm if you have varicose veins and plan your treatment. This is a type of scan to check your blood flow. There are several types of treatment that may be offered, including: procedures to block blood flow in the veins, such as endothermal ablation and foam sclerotherapy surgery to remove varicose veins compression stockings The specialist will explain which treatment may be best for you, and the benefits and risks. This is usually the first choice of treatment for varicose veins. It works by blocking blood flow in the veins, so they become less swollen. The main steps are: You'll usually be awake during the procedure. You'll have a local anaesthetic , so you will not feel any pain. A thin tube called a catheter is passed up your vein, from a small cut at your ankle or knee. An ultrasound scan is used to place the catheter. A device is put through the catheter and energy from radio waves (radiofrequency ablation) or a laser (endovenous laser treatment) is used to heat the vein that's causing your symptoms. This closes it off, so that blood stops flowing through it. The catheter is slowly removed. You'll have the procedure in a hospital or clinic. You'll be able to go home the same day. You may need to wear compression stockings for about a week. You may have some pain and bruising, but you should be able to go back to most of your usual activities straight away. You'll usually be offered foam sclerotherapy if endothermal ablation is not suitable for you. The main steps are: You'll be awake during the procedure. You'll have a local anaesthetic , so you will not feel any pain. You'll have injections into your vein of a chemical mixed with air (foam). An ultrasound scan is used to make sure the injections are in the right place. The chemical blocks the vein, so that blood stops flowing through it. You'll have the procedure in a hospital or clinic. You'll be able to go home the same day. You may need to wear compression stockings for about a week. You may have some pain and bruising, but you should be able to go back to most of your usual activities straight away. You may be offered surgery to remove varicose veins, called ligation and stripping, if simpler procedures are not suitable for you. The main steps are: The surgeon will mark your legs to show where the vein needs to be removed. You'll usually be asleep during the operation. You'll have a general anaesthetic , so you will not feel any pain. The surgeon makes 1 cut in your upper leg (groin) and a 2nd cut lower down your leg, at your knee or ankle. The surgeon finds the vein through the 1st cut and ties it, to stop blood flowing. A thin, flexible wire is passed down the vein to the 2nd cut. The surgeon uses the wire to pull the vein out. The cuts are closed using stitches that dissolve so they do not need to be removed. You can usually go home the same day. Moving around may be uncomfortable for a few days, and you may have some pain and bruising for a few weeks. You may need to take 1 to 2 weeks off work. Your leg will be tightly bandaged or you'll need to wear compression stockings for about a week. Compression stockings work by putting pressure on your lower legs. This improves your blood flow and can help with swelling and pain. You'll only be offered compression stockings for varicose veins if procedures or surgery are not suitable for you, or if you do not need other treatments. They're not suitable if you have problems with blood flow in your arteries. A specialist can check for this. There are different types of stockings, and it's important to talk to a doctor or pharmacist to make sure you get the right type for you. It's best to wear them during the day and remove them at bedtime."

It causes swelling and can help the body deal with invading germs. But in vasculitis, for some reason the immune system attacks healthy blood vessels, causing them to become swollen and narrow. This may be triggered by an infection, another underlying condition, or a medicine, although often the cause is unknown. Vasculitis can range from a minor problem that just affects the skin, to a more serious illness that causes problems with organs like the heart or kidneys. There are many types of vasculitis.

                "text": "Vitiligo is a long-term condition where pale white patches develop on the skin. It's caused by the lack of melanin, which is the pigment in skin. Vitiligo can affect any area of skin, but it commonly happens on the face, neck and hands, and in skin creases. The pale areas of skin are more vulnerable to sunburn, so it's important to take extra care when in the sun and use a sunscreen with a high sun protection factor (SPF)."

The lack of melanin in your skin can turn the hair in the affected area white or grey. Vitiligo often starts as a pale patch of skin that gradually turns completely white. The centre of a patch may be white, with paler skin around it. If there are blood vessels under the skin, the patch may be slightly pink, rather than white. The edges of the patch may be smooth or irregular. They're sometimes red and inflamed, or there's brownish discolouration (hyperpigmentation). Vitiligo does not cause discomfort to your skin, such as dryness, but the patches may occasionally be itchy. The condition varies from person to person. Some people only get a few small, white patches, but others get bigger white patches that join up across large areas of their skin. There's no way of predicting how much skin will be affected. The white patches are usually permanent."

If the patches are relatively small, skin camouflage cream can be used to cover them up. Steroid creams can also be used on the skin to restore some pigment, however long-term use can cause stretch marks and thinning of the skin If steroid creams do not work, phototherapy (treatment with light) may be used. Although treatment may help restore colour to your skin, the effect does not usually last. Treatment cannot stop the condition spreading. Find out more about treating vitiligo ."
