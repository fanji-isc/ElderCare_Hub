# Neighborhood Health Hub (NHH) — Demo Storyline: Fall Prevention

---

## The Character

**Barbara, 78** — retired schoolteacher, lives alone in her apartment. She has a history of:

- Right knee replacement surgery (8 months ago — recovery went well, but her gait never fully returned to normal)
- Mild osteoporosis (diagnosed 2022)
- Atrial fibrillation (managed with blood thinners — warfarin)
- Two prior falls (2023, 2024 — no fractures, but significant anxiety and reduced confidence walking afterward)
- Moderate dehydration tendencies (chronic, often doesn't feel thirst)

Her daughter **Linda** lives 45 minutes away. Her primary care provider is **NP Davis**.

## The Setup — Tuesday Morning, 7:00am

Barbara hasn't even gotten out of bed yet. NHH has already been working overnight — and Noha, her AI health companion, is about to start her day.

## Noha's Morning Check-In (Proactive — No Prompt Needed)

At 7:02am, before Barbara says a word, Noha speaks:

> "Good morning, Barbara! It's Tuesday, and I've been keeping an eye on you overnight. I want to share a few things. You had a restless night — only about 3 hours of deep sleep, which is lower than your usual. Your heart also worked a little harder than normal around 3am. And this morning your body is telling me it needs water — please drink a full glass before you do anything else. I also noticed your movement yesterday afternoon looked a little different from your usual — your steps were slower and a bit uneven, so I want you to be extra careful getting out of bed this morning. Your care team has already been notified, and Linda left you a message. How are you feeling right now?"

Barbara didn't have to ask anything. Noha came to her.

## Panel 1 — Care Provider View (NP Davis's Dashboard)

> "Here's what NP Davis sees when she logs in."

**Overnight risk alert, auto-generated:**

- **Sleep quality: Poor** — 3.2 hrs deep + REM (7-day average: 5.1 hrs)
- **Heart rate during sleep: Elevated** — resting HR peaked at 94 bpm at 3am (baseline: 62)
- **Gait & Movement Alert (flagged yesterday, 4:15pm):**
  - Walking velocity dropped to 0.6 m/s (her personal baseline: 0.95 m/s)
  - Stride asymmetry index: 18% — right leg (surgical side) bearing less weight than usual
  - Cadence variability: high — irregular step timing, a known predictor of near-term falls
  - NHH classification: Suspicious gait pattern detected — post-surgical compensation behavior
- **Daily Steps (Yesterday):** 1,840 steps — 54% below her daily average, suggesting fatigue or pain-avoidance
- **ECG History** — Last user-recorded ECG (February 4th) shows AFib-consistent pattern; available for comparison
- **Smart toilet (6:45am):** Urine color index dark amber — significant dehydration

**Composite fall-risk score: CRITICAL (91/100)**
*(Gait anomaly + dehydration + post-surgical history + poor sleep = highest-risk combination)*

NP Davis clicks Noha's summary:

> "Barbara had disrupted sleep, an elevated overnight heart rate, and significant dehydration this morning. Most notably, her wearable detected an abnormal gait pattern at 4:15pm yesterday — reduced walking speed, asymmetric weight distribution favoring the left leg, and irregular step timing. Combined with her right knee replacement 8 months ago and her fall history, this pattern is a recognized pre-fall indicator. I recommend contacting her physical therapist and scheduling a gait assessment this week."

Dr. Patel sends a care note to her file and flags it for her home nurse.


## Panel 2 — Family View (Linda's App)

> "Meanwhile, Linda gets a gentle notification — not alarming, but informative."

- **Yesterday afternoon:** "Barbara's walking pattern looked a little off — she was moving more slowly and unevenly than usual."
- **Last night's sleep:** Below average
- **Steps yesterday:** Low activity day
- **This morning:** Hydration reminder sent
- **Today's risk level:** High — "Barbara's care team has been notified. Noha checked in with her at 7am."

Linda sends Barbara a voice message through the app: "Morning Mom, saw you had a rough night — call me when you're up?"

She doesn't need to know the clinical details. She just knows to check in.

## Panel 3 — Patient View (Barbara talking with Noha)

> "After Noha's morning check-in, Barbara has questions. Here are the real things patients ask:"

**"Noha, my knee feels stiff this morning — is that normal?"**

> "Some stiffness after a night of rest is common after knee surgery, especially 8 months out. But I did notice yesterday your walking was a bit uneven — your right leg seemed to be doing less of the work. That's a signal I take seriously for someone with your history. I've let NP Davis know. Try some gentle ankle circles before you stand up, and use the armrest to push yourself up slowly."

**"Is it okay for me to go for my morning walk?"**

> "I'd say yes, but a shorter one today — and please use your walking cane. Your sleep was low, you're a little dehydrated, and yesterday's gait data showed your balance was off. Flat ground only, no rushing. If your knee starts to feel unstable or you feel dizzy, stop and sit down right away."


## The Twist — What Could Have Happened

**Without NHH:**

- Gait changes from Monday afternoon go unnoticed
- Barbara is dehydrated and under-slept Tuesday morning
- She gets up quickly, her right knee gives slightly, she reaches for the wall — falls
- Hip fracture. ER. $40,000 hospitalization. Potential re-injury to the surgical knee. 6-month setback.

**With NHH:**

- Gait anomaly flagged Monday at 4:15pm — 15 hours before the high-risk window
- Noha checked in at 7am unprompted — hydration addressed, cane recommended, family alerted
- NP Davis reviewed the gait data and ECG history before her first patient
- Physical therapist appointment booked for Thursday
- Barbara took a short, careful walk. Used her cane. Drank her water. Called Linda.

## The Closing Message

"Falls are the #1 cause of injury death in adults over 65. Most falls are preventable — but only if you see the warning signs before they happen. Neighborhood Health Hub connects the dots between a bad night's sleep, an irregular heartbeat, and a glass of water — so a Tuesday morning doesn't become a Tuesday emergency."
